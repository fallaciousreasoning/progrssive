The strategy seems to have been successful. Realme was India’s third biggest smartphone brand over the Diwali shopping season, according <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/online-channels-accounted-record-half-smartphones-sold-indian-diwali-festive-season/\">to Counterpoint Research</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP44856419\">IDC figures</a> put it in fourth place for the fourth quarter of 2018 — one place ahead of Oppo itself.</p>\n<p>Now Realme is launching its first 2019 device, the Realme 3, and it’s another impressive exercise in managing to bring advanced features down to a super-low price point. For comparison, the Realme 1 only came out last May and didn’t even have a fingerprint sensor. But the 3 could easily pass for a flagship-level device at first glance. </p>\n<p>Key to this is the 6.22-inch LCD with a “waterdrop” notch, which first showed up in Oppo’s F9 and later made its way to the OnePlus 6T. I still like the way it looks, even in this age of hole-punch displays and sliding cameras. The “chin” at the bottom of the screen is a little larger than you’d expect on a flagship device but it isn’t a big deal, especially not for this category. While the screen isn’t going to blow you away with its 720p resolution or passable viewing angles, it’s fine in regular use. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"realme 3\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D5PxtYJfbMYGpKXtYCyOQqRXEd8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15233732/DSCF6912.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>Around the back there’s a smooth curved frame with a flashy gradient interrupted only by the fingerprint sensor and vertically aligned camera module. The primary camera is 13 megapixels and the secondary sensor is 2 megapixels; Realme is touting an AI-powered ‘Nightscape’ mode, though I wouldn’t expect miracles. </p>\n<p>Other specs include a MediaTek Helio P70 processor (P60 outside India), a large 4,230mAh battery, a 13-megapixel selfie camera, and up to 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The Realme 3 runs Oppo’s ColorOS 6.0 based on Android 9 Pie, which interestingly enough moves the company’s software a little bit closer to “stock” Android with standard swiping gestures and an app drawer.</p>\n<p>The Realme 3 will be priced at Rs. 8,999 (~$125) for a model with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, while Rs. 10,999 (~$155) gets you twice the storage and an extra gigabyte of RAM. That’s aggressive pricing, undercutting strong competitors like Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 7. The Realme 3 should be available on Flipkart shortly.</p>",

            "content": "<div><div><div><p>German Data Privacy Commissioner Ulrich Kelber is also a computer scientist, which makes him uniquely qualified to comment on the potential consequences of the proposed new EU Copyright Directive. The Directive will be voted on at the end of this month, and its <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/worst-possible-version-eu-copyright-directive-has-sparked-german-uprising\">Article 13</a> requires that online communities, platforms, and services prevent their users from committing copyright infringement, rather than ensuring that infringing materials are speedily removed.</p>\n<p>In a new <a href=\"https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Pressemitteilungen/2019/10_Uploadfilter.html;jsessionid=B4190157E6A16C7DB3E58255422229E5.2_cid329\">official statement on the Directive</a> (<a href=\"http://www.fosspatents.com/2019/02/germanys-federal-data-protection.html#translation\">English translation</a>), Kelber warns that Article 13 will inevitably lead to the use of automated filters, because there is no imaginable way for the organisations that run online services to examine everything their users post and determine whether each message, photo, video, or audio clip is a copyright violation.</p>\n<p>Kelber goes on to warn that this will exacerbate the already dire problem of market concentration in the tech sector, and expose Europeans to particular risk of online surveillance and manipulation.</p>\n<p>That's because under Article 13, Europe's online companies will be <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/german-government-abandons-small-businesses-worst-parts-eu-copyright-directive\">required to block all infringement</a>, even if they are very small and specialised (the Directive gives an online community three years' grace period before it acquires this obligation, less time if the service grosses over €5m/year). These small- and medium-sized European services (SMEs) will not be able to afford to license the catalogues of the big movie, music, and book publishers, so they'll have to rely on filters to block the unlicensed material.</p>\n<p>But if a company is too small to afford licenses, it's also too small to build filters. Google's Content ID for YouTube cost a reported €100 million to build and run, and it only does a fraction of the blocking required under Article 13. That means that they'll have to buy filter services from someone else. The most likely filter vendors are the US Big Tech companies like Google and Facebook, who will have to build and run filters anyway, and could recoup their costs by renting access to these filters to smaller competitors.</p>\n<p>Another possible source of filtering services is companies that sell copyright enforcement tools like Audible Magic (<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/why-facebook-inspecting-your-private-videos\">supplier to Big Tech giants like Facebook</a>), who <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190121/17024041437/there-was-heavy-tech-lobbying-article-13-company-hoping-to-sell-everyone-filters.shtml\">have spent lavishly to lobby in favour of filters</a> (along with their <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2018/12/12/clash-of-the-corporate-titans.html\">competitors</a>).</p>\n<p>As Kelber explains, this means that Europeans who use European services in the EU will nevertheless likely have every public communication they make channeled into offshore tech companies' servers for analysis. These European services will then have to channel much of their revenues to the big US tech companies or specialist filter vendors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://saveyourinternet.eu/\">Take Action</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://saveyourinternet.eu/\">Stop Article 13</a></p>\n<p>So Article 13 guarantees America's giant companies a permanent share of all small EU companies' revenues <em>and</em> access to an incredibly valuable data-stream generated by all European discourse, conversation, and expression. These companies have a long track record of capitalising on users’ personal data to their advantage, and between that advantage and the revenues they siphon off of their small European competitors, they are likely to gain permanent dominance over Europe's Internet.</p>\n<p>Kelber says that this is the inevitable consequence of filters, and has challenged the EU to explain how Article 13's requirements could be satisfied without filters. He's called for &quot;a thoughtful overhaul&quot; of the bill based on &quot;data privacy considerations,&quot; describing the market concentration as a &quot;clear and present danger.&quot;</p>\n<p>We agree, and so do millions of Europeans. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/european-parliament-stop-the-censorship-machinery-save-the-internet\">the petition against Article 13</a> has attracted more signatures than any other petition in European history and is on track to be the most popular petition in the history of the human race within a matter of days.</p>\n<p>With less than a month to go before the final vote in the European Parliament on the new Copyright Directive, Kelber's remarks couldn't be more urgent. Subjecting Europeans' communications to mass commercial surveillance and arbitrary censorship is bad for human rights and free expression, but as Kelber so ably argues, it's also a disaster for competition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://saveyourinternet.eu/\">Take Action</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://saveyourinternet.eu/\">Stop Article 13</a></p>\n</div></div></div>",

The new electric car will be Tesla’s fifth since the company was founded in 2003. </p>\n<p>The Model Y will share about 75 percent of its parts with the Model 3, which is currently Tesla’s most affordable car. Musk said the Model Y will be about 10 percent bigger, cost about 10 percent more, and will have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1102338251497431040?s=19\">slightly less range than the Model 3</a>. The Model Y <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1102340302663180288\">won’t have</a> the “Falcon Wing” doors that are found on Tesla’s bigger SUV, the Model X. (Musk had <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2015/10/6/9463149/tesla-model-y-teased-elon-musk-twitter\">previously hinted that it might</a>.) </p>\n<div><aside><q>The Model Y SUV will have a lot in common with the Model 3, but will cost a little more</q></aside></div>\n<p>More details on specs and pricing will be revealed at the event, according to Musk, and Tesla will offer test rides, meaning the company likely has a few pre-production prototypes already finished. Musk also said on Sunday that Tesla will unveil its electric pickup truck “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1102343438668713986\">later this year</a>.” </p>\n<p>Tesla will build the Model Y at the company’s Gigafactory outside Reno, Nevada, and the vehicle is supposed to enter volume production in 2020. Tesla also eventually plans to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1082143023272730629?lang=en\">make Model Ys at the Gigafactory it’s building in Shanghai</a>, China. </p>\n<p>Musk’s announcement comes just three days after Tesla finally made the long-promised $35,000 Model 3 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18245165/tesla-model-3-price-lower-cost-elon-musk-news\">available to purchase</a>. The company also announced last week that it is transitioning to an online-only sales model going forward, is closing “many” of its stores around the world, and is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18245296/tesla-stores-closing-online-only-car-sales\">laying off an undisclosed number of workers</a>. </p>\n<p>Tesla has only shown one teaser image of the Model Y to this point: a simple black-and-white silhouette. But the company’s been talking about the car for years. In 2015, Musk tweeted the name of the Model Y <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2015/10/6/9463149/tesla-model-y-teased-elon-musk-twitter\">before quickly deleting the tweet</a>. He also went <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/3/15537612/elon-musk-teased-new-details-tesla-model-y\">back and forth</a> on whether the compact SUV would be built on the same technological platform as the Model 3, before ultimately deciding to share technology between the cars in order to be able to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/2/16087444/tesla-model-y-vehicle-architecture-model-3-elon-musk\">bring the Model Y to market on time</a>. Musk said Tesla signed off on the final <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/24/18020936/teslas-model-y-crossover-prototype-production\">design late last year</a>. </p>\n<p>Musk had previously joked that the Model Y would be unveiled on March 15th “<a href=\"https://electrek.co/2018/05/24/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-sets-march-15-as-model-y-reveal-date-or-does-he/\">because the Ides of March sounded good</a>.” A few Chinese media outlets had speculated earlier this month that Tesla might wait to reveal the car at <a href=\"https://www.electrive.com/2019/02/26/tesla-model-y-to-debut-at-auto-shanghai/\">April’s Shanghai Auto Show</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Model Y unveil event on March 14 at LA Design Studio</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1102332778492772352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 3, 2019</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Musk also tweeted Sunday that the third version of its “Supercharger” electric car charging stations will be revealed this coming week. The first public station will go live at 8PM PT on Wednesday, March 6th, though he didn’t reveal the location. </p>\n<p>Version 3 of Tesla’s Supercharger is supposed to be able to charge cars at a rate of 350kW or more, according to <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2019/03/03/tesla-supercharger-v3/\">previous tweets from Musk</a>. That would help the company keep pace with some budding competition in the space. Porsche has said it will build 350kW chargers for its much-anticipated lineup of electric sports cars, and Volkswagen has already begun building a network of charging stations under the Electrify America brand that can charge between 150kW and 350kW. Tesla’s current Superchargers have a max rate of 145kW, and its cars can only accept up to 120kW. </p>\n<p><em>Developing...</em></p>",

While that may work on paper, <a href=\"https://dmcaforce.com/\">DMCAForce</a> appears to take the direct opposite approach.</p>\n<p>The anti-piracy outfit, which works with a wide <a href=\"https://transparencyreport.google.com/copyright/reporters/8237\">variety of clients</a> including Dreamroom Productions, Liberty Media, and Udemy, is actively seeking cooperation with pirate sites.</p>\n<p>Over the past several years, the company has regularly asked torrent sites, hosting platforms, and streaming services to remove content, and still does. But, in an email to the <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-popular-torrent-sites-of-2019/\">prominent</a> torrent site <a href=\"https://www.limetorrents.info/\">LimeTorrents</a>, DMCAForce also included a “revenue sharing” opportunity.</p>\n<p>“DMCAForce recently launched a new way for File Sharing sites to work with content creators. Where you as the file sharing site can distribute their content for free, but in exchange provide the advertising space around the product,” the email reads.</p>\n<p>“In the case of direct products, we can provide you affiliate tracking links, where instead of REMOVING the content, you can KEEP the content up, and we direct that user together back to the product on a commission basis,” the company adds.</p>\n<p>The anti-piracy outfit explains that it has already made deals in the adult space. This worked well, with one of the producers currently generating $15,000 in advertising revenue per month from a single site.</p>\n<p>“This has encouraged content creators to keep their content up and build a better relationship,” DMCAForce notes.</p>\n<p>The operator of LimeTorrents, who’s not interested in the deal, was asked to reply within three days to find out how it can monetize the content. If not, the anti-piracy outfit said it would proceed with a regular DMCA takedown notice.</p>\n<p>The revenue sharing program is fairly new. In addition to reaching out to file-sharing sites, DMCAForce also invites its clients to join the program.</p>\n<p>“If you have a product you are selling, and want to ask these pirate sites to put advertising around your stolen content or replace the stolen content with linkbacks, we offer that as well,” DMCAForce informed its clients recently.</p>\n<p>It’s quite unique for an anti-piracy company to offer a monetization option to what it sees as pirate sites. We, therefore, would love to find out more about the details of the program. Unfortunately, however, DMCAForce did not immediately reply to our request for comment.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/\">TF</a>, for the latest info on copyright, file-sharing, <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-popular-torrent-sites-of-2018-180107/\">torrent sites</a> and more.

However, it also allows Saudi men to track female dependents and control their movement. </p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/absher-saudi-website-men-control-women-stop-escape-2019-1\">recent report from <em>Insider</em></a> outlined how Saudi men could use the app to control female dependents, as it can be used to revoke travel privileges, keep tabs on their location, and send SMS messages with updates about their whereabouts. Following the publication of the report, human rights groups such as Amnesty International have criticized both companies for hosting the app. At the same time, <a href=\"https://speier.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-speier-calls-apple-and-google-remove-saudi-government-app-tracking\">Speier and a group of fellow representatives</a> sent a letter to the CEOs of Google and Apple, asking them to pull the app from their respective stores. </p>\n<p><em>Business Insider</em> reports that Google has responded to the congressional letter, and that the app remains in Google’s storefront. In a statement to <em>BI</em>, Speier called the response “deeply unsatisfactory,” and that she plans to follow up with the issue with her colleagues. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223114/absher-criticism-google-apple-saudi-arabia-track-women-tim-cook\">Apple CEO Tim Cook said that he will look into the issue</a> during an interview with NPR, but has yet to say whether or not it will reject the app from the App Store. </p>",

Founded in 2015 in London, it describes itself as an alternative to traditional banking by doing away with fees, and says that it has more than 4 million customers who have transferred more than £25 billion across 250 million transactions. The service hasn’t launched yet in the US — the company says on its website that that’s coming, and has a waitlist for interested users. </p>\n<p><em>Wired</em>’s report outlines some of the growing pains that seems too familiar with startups working to grow at all costs. It details a company with a 24/7 work mentality and managers who set exceedingly high goals for its staff — and which will abruptly fire employees who fall below expectations. The report details a culture of work-at-all costs and burnout, and notes that a survey of former employees revealed that most didn’t last more than a year. </p>\n<div><aside><q>A 24/7 workplace culture where burnout is rampant </q></aside></div>\n<p>The report also detailed how prospective employees were presented with a test — sign up 200 people in a week, in order to be considered for a followup interview, which <em>Wired</em> notes “might go against governmental recommendations.” Revolut didn’t answer <em>Wired</em>’s questions about its workplace culture, but did say in a statement that its “culture is evolving as rapidly as our business.”</p>\n<p>More <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/02/28/revolut-failed-block-suspicious-transactions/\">damning is a pair of reports from <em>The Telegraph</em></a>, which says that the company turned off automated systems that worked to stop money laundering and illegal transfers between July and September last year. The company launched an investigation last year when a whistleblower notified the board of directors, which concluded that the “original decision to turn off the transaction-halting mechanism was erroneous and implied a remediable systems and controls failing.” <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/02/28/revolut-cfo-resigns-company-faces-compliance-questions/\"><em>The Telegraph</em> also says</a> that the company’s CFO resigned in January, although Revolut says that it was unconnected to the incident. </p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://blog.revolut.com/let-me-sec-the-record-straight/\">blog post on its website</a>, Revolut CEO Nikolay Storonsky pushed back against <em>The Telegraph’s</em> report, saying that it had rolled out a “more advanced sanctions screening system,” which didn’t work as expected. He also says that the company has reviewed all of the transactions that occurred during that period, and that no money laundering had occurred. </p>",

(By things I mean ads.) <em>Fortnite</em>, though, has managed to stay culturally relevant and even grow since its 2017 launch — which is unusual. And that’s because its creator, Epic Games, has figured out how to get people to keep paying attention.</p>\n<p>“Paying attention” was a phrase before it became a literalization, before canny people realized just how much money time is worth. The advertising industry — and therefore the industries it supports, like the media — is predicated on the idea that if you’ve heard of something and have a positive association with it, you’re more likely to buy the product or the experience. And that isn’t wrong: people make decisions for reasons unfathomable even to themselves <em>all the time</em>. It makes sense to monetize humanity’s fundamental irrationality. (Sucks to the economists who peddled the Rational Consumer model of microeconomic behavior!) But the base assumption that the whole edifice is built on is becoming unstable, because what happens when society’s attention is entirely monopolized? </p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/major-games-publishers-are-feeling-the-impact-of-peaking-attention/\">recent report</a> put out by the media and technology research firm Midia underscores that point: “[E]ngagement has declined throughout the sector, suggesting that the attention economy has peaked. Consumers simply do not have any more free time to allocate to new attention seeking digital entertainment propositions, which means they have to start prioritising between them.” The trend, they write, has persisted for a while, and only now promises a revenue slowdown — as told through disappointing quarterly results from a few of the major games publishers. “Arguably sooner than most of the games industry would have thought.” As Midia researcher Karol Severin says, “competition within the attention economy is now more intense than ever before.” </p>\n<p>The problem is attention doesn’t scale. There is only so much time in the day to be advertised to; ads themselves are becoming less effective, because they’re now everywhere. When was the last time you consumed something that wasn’t trying to sell you something, or harvest your personal data to sell you things better?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Enter <em>Fortnite</em>. As the most popular game in the world — or at least the most well known — it represents a substantial portion of the attention economy. <em>Fortnite</em> is ubiquitous among the under-18 set, and its microtransactions have reaped billions in profits for Epic Games. It really can’t be overstated just how popular the game is among young people: it’s become a shared culture, with all the in-jokes, references, and coded language that entails. If you’re around two or more kids, the chance that they’ll do a dance from the game grows <em>astronomically</em>.</p>\n<p>But Epic’s real genius is in how it markets to the game’s young audience: <em>Fortnite</em> is, above everything else, a place to hang out with your friends. That’s why it isn’t weird that <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/2/28/18241658/fortnite-season-8-weezer-jukebox-music-island\">Weezer is playing unreleased songs on an in-game island</a>, and nobody bats an eye when the DJ and producer <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/18/18229471/fortnite-marshmello-pleasant-park-live-music-future-past\">Marshmello plays a concert in a virtual park</a>.</p>\n<div><aside><q>Companies like Netflix see Fortnite as a competitor</q></aside></div>\n<p>The game’s immense popularity, and its status as a hang-out spot, has its competitors in the attention economy worried. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/17/18187400/netflix-vs-fortnite-hbo-hulu-competition\">Netflix mentioned in its 2018 earnings report</a> that “we compete with (and lose to) <em>Fortnite</em> more than HBO.” <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/17/18187400/netflix-vs-fortnite-hbo-hulu-competition\">As <em>Polygon</em> noted</a> then, Netflix sees the game as its “stiffest competition” because, to the streaming giant, the most valuable consumer metric is screen time. If people are playing <em>Fortnite</em>, they can’t be watching Netflix.</p>\n<p>That means the ads (and bands, it seems) have arrived. It’s not hard to imagine <em>Fortnite</em> turning into a place where the ads are unobtrusive yet ubiquitous, like in those hallucinogenic cyberpunk movies of the past. The game has already <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/23/18108602/fortnite-wreck-it-ralph-crossover-cameo-breaks-the-internet\">done promotional work</a> for Disney’s release of <em>Ralph Breaks the Internet</em> and has <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/8/17332600/fortnite-thanos-infinity-gauntlet-is-the-best\">introduced <em>Avengers</em> villain Thanos</a> into the mix with little complaint from players. That might have been because the collaborations were limited-time, low-stakes, and didn’t particularly affect gameplay, <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2018/5/8/17330190/fortnite-avengers-mashup-thanos-infinity-gauntlet\">unless as in the case of Thanos</a>, you wanted it to.</p>\n<p><em>Fortnite</em>’s model, too, allows for these kinds of otherwise invasive changes. Every couple months, Epic rolls out a massive update that overhauls the map and the items featured — Epic calls them seasons, exactly like television. And each serves the same purpose: to bring players back for just a little longer, and also to stave off competition from other battle royale-style games. <em>Fortnite</em>’s latest update cribbed at least two major features from <em>Apex Legends</em>, the first battle royale from publisher EA. (<em>Apex</em> managed to find a wild <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/apex-legends/apex-legends-player-count\">25 million players in just under a month</a>, after a surprise, no-promo release; it’s currently the only real competition <em>Fortnite </em>has in the space.) “It’s not that it’s particularly better or worse suited for the attention economy than others, but it does strike a chord with generations, who typically have more time to allocate, which is why it is doing so well in the attention economy,” says Severin. “I believe it’s more a matter of a generationally cultural shift: <em>Fortnite</em> is among the first to build a truly successful business model of selling digital items which don’t give players any progress in the actual game. They are just cosmetic” Twenty years ago, he continued, people defined themselves by the clothes they wore and what they listened to. “Today, consumers’ personal image is in much larger part defined in the virtual world.”</p>\n<div><aside><q>‘Today, consumers’ personal image is in much larger part defined in the virtual world‘</q></aside></div>\n<p>That Netflix is even acknowledging <em>Fortnite</em> as a competitor is important, because it means that digital media companies are beginning to concede that growth isn’t infinite, and are shifting their ambitions in response. Netflix won’t release a battle royale game. (Probably.) But I’d bet they’ll continue to experiment with interactives — like <em>Black Mirror</em>’s latest episode, “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing\">Bandersnatch</a>.”</p>\n<p>While <em>Black Mirror</em>’s audience is mostly adult, it’s not a coincidence that the company has interactive offerings aimed at younger people, who are in the same demographic <em>Fortnite</em> has captured. Netflix partnered with the now-defunct Telltale Games for an interactive cartoon version of <em>Minecraft: Story Mode</em>. A <em>Stranger Things</em>-inspired collaboration was also in the works <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17934166/telltale-games-studio-closed-layoffs-end-the-walking-dead\">before Telltale shut down</a>, and Netflix says it’s still “in the process of evaluating other options for bringing the <em>Stranger Things</em> universe to life in an interactive medium,” <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/24/17896054/netflix-stranger-things-telltale-game-update\">according to <em>Polygon</em></a>.</p>\n<p><em>Fortnite</em>’s eighth season started just a couple days ago, and the island has changed again. This time, there is a volcano with lava, cannons to shoot yourself out of, and a pirate theme; familiar locations had been replaced with new ones that players will sink hours into mastering. When I logged on the other day, the other players seemed better, somehow — as though they’d only just returned from playing another game somewhere else, and craved a return to the familiar. </p>\n<p></p>",

Well, here’s the sequel: <a href=\"http://WhichFaceIsReal.com\">WhichFaceIsReal.com</a>, which lets you test your ability to distinguish AI-generated fakes from the genuine article. Just head to the site and click on who you think is the real person!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://whichfaceisreal.com/\">WhichFaceIsReal.com</a> also has a higher purpose though. It was set up by two academics from the University of Washington, Jevin West and Carl Bergstrom, both of whom study how information spreads through society. They think the rise of AI-generated fakes could be trouble, undermining society’s trust in evidence, and want to educate the masses.</p>\n<p>“When a new technology like this comes along, the most dangerous period is when the technology is out there but the public isn’t aware of it,” Bergstrom tells <em>The Verge</em>. “That’s when it can be used most effectively.”</p>\n<p>“So what we’re trying to do is educate the public, make people aware that this technology is out there,” says West. “Just like eventually most people were made aware that you can Photoshop an image.” </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zUP4x_ka_Sdh0TUVwyggW6-MA9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13762264/fake_ai_faces.png\">\n<figcaption>\n<em>Fake faces generated by </em>ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Both sites use a machine learning method known as a generative adversarial network (or GAN for short) to generate their fakes. These networks operate by poring through huge stacks of data (in this case, a lot of portraits of real people); learning the patterns within them, and then trying to replicate what they’ve seen. </p>\n<p>The reason GANs are so good is that they test themselves. One part of the network generates faces, and the other compares them to the training data. If it can tell the difference, the generator is sent back to the drawing board to improve its work. Think of it like a strict art teacher who won’t let you leave the class until you draw the right number of eyes on your charcoal portrait. There’s no room for AI Picassos — realism only. </p>\n<div><aside><q>“the most dangerous period is when the technology is out there but the public isn’t aware of it.”</q></aside></div>\n<p>These techniques can be used to manipulate audio and video as well as images. Although there are limitations to what such systems can do (you can’t type a caption for a picture you want to exist and have it magicked into being) they are improving steadily. Deepfakes can turn videos of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/14/17859188/ai-deepfakes-national-security-threat-lawmakers-letter-intelligence-community\">politicians into puppets</a> and they can even turn you into a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/26/17778792/deepfakes-video-dancing-ai-synthesis\">great dancer</a>.</p>\n<p>With this case of AI-generated faces, Bergstrom and West note that one malicious use might be spreading misinformation after a terrorist attack. For example, AI could be used to generate a fake culprit that’s circulated online, spread on social networks. </p>\n<p>In these scenarios journalists usually try to verify the source of an image, using tools like Google’s Reverse Image search. But that wouldn’t work on an AI fake. “If you wanted to inject misinformation into a situation like that, if you post a picture of the perpetrator and it’s someone else it’ll get corrected very quickly,” says Bergstrom. “But if you use a picture of someone that doesn’t exist at all? Think of the difficulty of tracking that down.”</p>\n<p>They note that academics and researchers are developing plenty of tools that can spot deepfakes. “My understanding is that right now it’s actually quite easy to do,” notes West. And taking the test above you probably found you could differentiate between the AI-generated faces and real people. There are a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@kcimc/how-to-recognize-fake-ai-generated-images-4d1f6f9a2842\">number of tells</a>, including asymmetrical faces, misaligned teeth, unrealistic hair, and ears that, well, just don’t look like ears. </p>\n<p>But these fakes will get better. In another three years [these fakes] will be indistinguishable,” says West. And when that happens, knowing will be half the battle. Says Bergstrom: “Our message is very much not that people should not believe in anything. Our message is the opposite: it’s don’t be credulous.”</p>",

            "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.—Believe it or not, getting to space wasn’t the hard part.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the past few years, SpaceX has mastered launching Falcon 9 rockets and putting payloads in space. The company has also perfected an intricate maneuver that returns rocket boosters to Earth, landing them gently on the ground or on a ship off the Atlantic coast, to be spruced up and used again. Last year, it launched<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/21/18151626/spacex-falcon-9-gps-iii-launch-air-force-watch-live\"> more than 20 rockets</a> to space without incident.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On Saturday morning, a Falcon 9 again <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/spacex-nasa-commercial-crew-launch-success/584008/?utm_source=feed\">soared</a> above Kennedy Space Center painting a streak of gold against the night sky, and deposited a spacecraft into orbit. After the launch was over, SpaceX engineers braced for the next hurdle. A mistake could put the spacecraft, the International Space Station, or both at risk.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“The ISS still has three people on board, and so this vehicle coming up to the ISS for the first time has to work,” Kirk Shireman, the manager of the ISS program, said in the days leading up to the launch. “It has to work.”</p><p>SpaceX manufactured the spacecraft, named Dragon, as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/nasa-prepares-pivotal-spacex-launch-iss/583906/?utm_source=feed\">part of a NASA program</a> to return human spaceflight to American soil for the first time since 2011. There were no people on board this mission, only a spacesuit-clad mannequin named Ripley, about 400 pounds of cargo, and a plush toy in the shape of Earth, a cute indicator that started to float when the spacecraft reached microgravity. But there could be humans on board as soon as this summer—if the mission goes well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">SpaceX has visited the ISS before. NASA contracts the company to deliver supplies and science experiments on another version of the Dragon spacecraft, designed only for cargo. When those capsules approach, a powerful robotic arm on the station, controlled by an astronaut inside, reaches out to grab them and pull them toward a port.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But the crew-friendly Dragon was designed for a far more complicated rendezvous. The ISS has been preparing for the arrival of a commercially built spacecraft like Dragon for years. A new docking port was<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/13/12172822/nasa-docking-adapter-spacex-boeing-commercial-crew\"> delivered</a> to the station by SpaceX itself in 2016. Astronauts installed new wiring and even rerouted ventilation in this part of the station so that power and air could flow to the spacecraft once it was docked. “It was a massive modification with an incredible amount of hardware,” Susan Freeman, an ISS engineer at NASA’s Johnson Space Center,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GodspeedDiscvry/status/1102142711916883969\"> tweeted</a> Sunday morning.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The capsule is equipped with software, sensors, and lasers to autonomously guide it toward and then stick itself to a port. Astronauts on the station can transmit important information to the spacecraft’s computers as it nears, but the final docking is up to the Dragon.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After reaching space, the Dragon spacecraft circled the Earth 18 times, firing engines to put itself on a trajectory toward the ISS. When the capsule neared the station, it moved closer and then backed away, practicing a retreat designed for emergencies.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Then, just before 6 a.m ET on Sunday, about 260 miles above the northern coast of New Zealand, the Dragon spacecraft stuck itself onto the ISS. For the first time in nearly eight years, an American-made spacecraft designed to carry humans had arrived at humankind’s home in space.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Cameras on the ISS captured the steady approach. At first, Dragon appeared as a white blob against the matte black of space. As the distance between the two spacecraft shrunk, the Dragon came into full view, its white exterior gleaming in the sunlight. A cover at the nose of the spaceship had been flipped open not long after launch, revealing a ring of springs. As the Dragon made contact with a port on the ISS, the springs absorbed the impact. On the port, a dozen hooks latched the capsule into place.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Back on Earth, SpaceX headquarters erupted in cheers at the sight. Elon Musk, the company’s founder, no doubt exhaled. The mission has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/elon-musk-spacex-commercial-crew-nasa/584011/?utm_source=feed\">scrambled his nerves</a>. “To be frank, I’m a little emotionally exhausted,” a serious-faced Musk told reporters on Saturday, an hour after the launch. “Because that was super stressful. But it worked—so far. We have to dock with station, we have to come back. But so far, it’s worked.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Here’s the view from the ISS, at left, and from Dragon, at right:</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpaceX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SpaceX</a> Crew Dragon is attached to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Space_Station?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Space_Station</a>!

After the Dragon docked, the crew prepared to go inside. They conducted a series of checks, including an inspection on the airtight seal of the spacecraft and the air pressure inside a vestibule between them. Cameras inside the station showed the crew floating around a square-shaped hatch, sliding their socked feet under wall railings to anchor themselves when they needed to use their arms.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Two hours later, they were ready. “Houston station, Dragon hatch opened,” McClain said. The scene, captured now on a camera inside the Dragon, was surreal. The astronauts, wearing protective masks, floated about the cabin, inspecting the interior and collecting readings of the environment. It was difficult to say who looked more out of place: Ripley the mannequin in a sleek white-and-black spacesuit, or the crew, in pale-blue polo T-shirts and loose pants.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Astronauts on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Space_Station?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Space_Station</a> have opened the hatch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpaceX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SpaceX</a>’s Crew Dragon spacecraft!

They floated into the capsule again, where McClain held up the plush Earth to the camera.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Before the launch, Russia<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/spacex-nasa-russia-commercial-crew/583756/?utm_source=feed\"> seemed hesitant</a> about SpaceX’s unprecedented maneuver. Roscosmos, which controls half of ISS, was concerned about the capsule’s docking software, which diverged from what other spacecraft have used to rendezvous with the station. NASA officials believed the software configuration was safe, and wanted to move forward. It was an uncomfortable moment between the two nations, but just days before liftoff, Roscosmos gave its approval for the launch.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After the Dragon spacecraft’s seamless docking, Roscosmos offered a rather passive-aggressive message of congratulations <a href=\"https://twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1102174742537224192\">on Twitter</a>. It commended NASA, but left out SpaceX, and added that flight safety must be impeccable.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The snub likely comes from the top. Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, doesn’t seem to be a fan of Musk. Last month, Rogozin<a href=\"https://twitter.com/katlinegrey/status/1098528084763004928\"> told</a> Russian media that he doesn’t believe SpaceX can build better rocket engines than Russia can. “Musk is not a technical expert in this matter,” Rogozin<a href=\"https://www.interfax.ru/russia/651354\"> said</a>. “He just doesn’t understand what this is about.” Musk<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1098532871155810304?lang=en\"> responded</a> on Twitter, pointing out that “I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day 1.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For Musk, the docking speaks for itself. But the mission isn’t over yet. The Dragon spacecraft will spend the week at the ISS. The crew will eventually replace the new supplies with cargo destined for home. The hatch will be sealed up, and the spacecraft will prepare for more high-stakes maneuvers, including a fiery plunge through Earth’s atmosphere and a gentle parachute ride to the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If the Dragon returns home in one piece, SpaceX and NASA will spend weeks reviewing data and completing more tests. Ripley’s ride will be over, but another journey—far more thrilling and nerve-wracking—may follow.</p><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/BNjqd2uxKPk\" height=\"1\">",

If that sounds a bit like the plot of a <em>Star Wars</em> film, that’s by design: the book is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/13/16885392/black-star-renegades-michael-moreci-star-wars-science-fiction-book-review\">an admitted homage to George Lucas’ franchise</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Black Star Renegades</em> is a fun, pulpy, familiar read: a dash across space with a lovable band of misfits trying to stay one step ahead of Queen Ga Halle of the Praxis, an evil empire with plans on total galactic domination. Cade and his brother Tristan are brought into a group of spiritual warriors known as the Rai, and after Tristan is killed, Cade discovers that he can wield the Rokura, a mythical, unstoppable weapon, and confronts Ga Halle, ultimately destroying a Praxis superweapon, the War Hammer. </p>\n<aside><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data=\"{&quot;stories&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Black Star Renegades is a loving homage to Star Wars&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/13/16885392/black-star-renegades-michael-moreci-star-wars-science-fiction-book-review&quot;}]}\"></div></aside><p>One of the more appealing elements of <em>Black Star Renegades</em> was the idea of taking something like<em> Star Wars</em> down to its base elements, and reconfiguring them into something new, but recognizable. Moreci’s book reflects this attitude: it’s clearly an homage to the film franchise, but it takes the things like starfighter battles, fight scenes, and characters struggling with larger destinies and fights of good against evil, and reimagines them in a new mode. The book reads as though it was <em>Star Wars</em> imagined in 2017, rather than 1977. </p>\n<p>Next month, Moreci will return to the universe with a sequel, <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250117854\"><em>We Are Mayhem</em></a><em>,</em> which takes place shortly after the events of the first book. As was the case in <em>A New Hope</em>, the fight against the Praxis has only just begun in <em>Renegades</em>; the loss of the War Hammer kicks off a wave of oppression across the galaxy, with Cade and his companions leading a rebel movement to face off against them. But while Cade possesses the Rokura, he doesn’t know how to use it, and sets off on a journey to uncover the origins of the legendary weapon to try to discover how to use it. </p>\n<p><em>We Are Mayhem</em> is due out on April 9th, and Moreci spoke with <em>The Verge</em> about what to expect in the sequel. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_49JaIcHsPsoBPZIpB0RllyqcRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11359363/28427394938_0b47371d9e_o.jpg\">\n<cite>Image: St. Martin’s Press</cite>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>You were up front about </strong><em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em><strong>’ influence on </strong><em><strong>Black Star Renegades</strong></em><em><strong>;</strong></em><strong> what about the franchise appeals to you the most, and what elements did you want to do for yourself?</strong></p>\n<p>I could answer this question all day long and still have things to say. For the sake of everyone’s time, I’ll be very brief: all my life, I’ve wanted to be a storyteller. It’s the only thing I’ve ever dreamed myself being, and it’s the only thing I think I’m capable of doing. And at the core of my storytelling heart is <em>Star Wars</em>. It’s been there since I was born, and like so many other people, it touches me in a way that nothing else does. It’s heroic and romantic; deeply innovative and so very human. <em>Star Wars</em> captured my imagination like nothing else, and it does so in a way that connects to me personally. I understand Luke’s journey, even Rey’s journey. Yoda’s Dagobah speech about what the Force is, is one of the most spiritual moments of my life. I can go on, but suffice to say <em>Star Wars</em> has been there with me, and for me, my entire life, and that’s why I have no qualms writing a book that is considered to be a love letter to this galaxy far, far away. </p>\n<p>And when I sat down to write that love letter, what I wanted to do was capture that feeling. <em>Black Star Renegades</em> is an adventure, first and foremost. It’s big on characters and their bonds; it’s about self-discovery and heroism, responsibility and galactic turmoil. I wanted it to feel big and intimate all at once, and I hope, at least some of the time, I hit the mark. </p>\n<p><strong>What is it about </strong><em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em><strong> that appeals to audiences, and do those elements translate into a non-</strong><em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em><strong> environment? What types of things do you need to change or create yourself to improve upon those tropes in your own works?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s a good number of things that have broad appeal, but maybe the most powerful is its ability to be simple but profound. I love sci-fi, but let’s face it: The genre has a tendency to be really complicated at times, in its stories, world-building, and even its message. And don’t get me wrong — I really enjoy that stuff. But for the masses, it ain’t. <em>Star Wars</em> takes a lot of the elements of sci-fi and gives them a more mainstream appeal, focusing more — as Lucas has said countless times — on an epic family story than anything else. Despite being set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, it’s infinitely relatable in very straightforward terms. </p>\n<p>Similarly, that’s what I strive for when writing in the <em>Black Star Renegades</em> universe. Granted, there’s a fine line between simple and broad, but I want to capture that sense of intimate reliability. I do so, though, in reframing the story through my own particular lens. Cade Sura is not a hero like Luke — in fact, he actively avoids the adventure and responsibility Luke seeks. While similar in approach to <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Black Star Renegades </em>and <em>We Are Mayhem </em>are telling a story that questions a lot of the things <em>Star Wars</em> endorses, particularly its reliance on hero’s journey tropes. </p>\n<p><strong>What were some of the challenges that you faced in writing a </strong><em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em><strong>-but-not</strong><strong>-</strong><em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em><strong> adventure? </strong></p>\n<p>As much as these books are very much love letters to <em>Star Wars</em>, I wanted them to be my own thing. And I think they are — especially <em>We Are Mayhem</em>. It was a challenge to straddle that line, but the more I wrote, the more I realized the books are deconstructing a lot of the <em>Star Wars</em> mythos as much as they’re celebrating them. I found the beating heart of my story in breaking down and reframing the messiah complex that threads throughout the <em>Star Wars</em> stories, this idea that one lone person can — and should — save the galaxy. (Though <em>The Last Jedi</em> stole my thunder with this!) </p>\n<p>I wanted my story to consciously divert from that and relegate power from the hands of one to the hands of many; that’s the message I wanted to convey, and I think, in our tumultuous political / cultural times, it’s an important one. We’re our own saviors; we don’t need one lone person with a laser sword (as Luke puts it in <em>TLJ</em>) to solve all our problems. </p>\n<p><strong>Beyond </strong><em><strong>Black Star Renegades</strong></em><strong>, you’re best known for your work in comics. How has that experienced help</strong><strong>ed</strong><strong> you with this novel?</strong></p>\n<p>Writing comics, to me, is all about stories that move and have movement. You’re writing for art, for things that will be drawn, and you want those things to be propulsive, to be big and explosive in the way only comics can be. I’ve been complimented a lot — and very grateful for every compliment — about how the first book reads so fast, and how the action sequences are so fluid. That’s something I definitely learned from comics — how to choreograph action, more or less. And it has served me well. I like writing big, I like writing fun, and I’m fortunate that both comics and novels let me scratch both creative itches. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Black Star Renegades</strong></em><strong> featured a condensed hero’s journey from unwilling hero to saving the galaxy</strong><strong>;</strong><strong> what comes next for the characters, and how are you building on this for the next book?</strong></p>\n<p>My main goal was to mature both the characters and the story. In the first book, Cade came of age, so to speak. Now, he has to deal with what that means, what it means to accept responsibility and actively pursue the fight for freedom and justice. Similarly, Kira experiences her own turmoil; she’s gotten what she wanted — to lead an uprising against the evil Praxis kingdom — and now she has to face what that really means. The stakes are higher for all the characters in the book; their personal stakes as well as the more general “the galaxy is at war” stakes. And that has lead to a story that’s a bit deeper than the first book, and it certainly has more gravity. </p>\n<p><em><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></em><strong> has become a sort of short hand explanation for “make things darker for the heroes.” How are you </strong><strong>avoiding</strong><strong> </strong><strong>the</strong><strong> cliché</strong><strong> trap with this sequel, </strong><em><strong>We Are Mayhem</strong></em><strong>?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s a good question, because everyone says that about their sequel, in any genre: “It’s like <em>Empire Strikes Back</em>.” But what I don’t think they get is the shorthand they’re using is inevitability. By law of storytelling, the second part <em>has</em> to be darker; the stakes are higher, the goal has not been achieved, and the Honeymoon period of meeting the heroes is over. You’re neck-deep in conflict now, and there’s hardly anywhere to go but darker (assuming this is a continuing story, of course). </p>\n<p><strong>What can readers expect </strong><strong>with </strong><em><strong>Mayhem</strong></em><strong>?</strong></p>\n<p>I wrote the first book with a lot of nervous energy powering my engine. It was my first published novel — something I’ve wanted to do my entire life — and I wrote it in eight months, which isn’t a whole lot of time. And I think that book is a reflection of that nervous, compressed energy. Don’t get me wrong — writing a book still terrifies me. But with book two, I felt more in control of that energy. And I had more time to write it. The result, in my opinion, is a book that’s a little more patient, a little more introspective. The characters are richer and deeper; the story is more complex. The fun is still there — there’s no way I would leave that out. The backbone of the <em>Black Star Renegades</em> universe, now and forever, is the way in which I tap into the things I love — specifically rollicking space adventure stories in the spirit of <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>,<em> Buck Rogers</em>, etc. That’ll never change. </p>\n<p><strong>Beyond the publication of your book, what impact to you see the new glut of </strong><em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em><strong> films having on the publishing industry? </strong></p>\n<p>To be honest, I haven’t seen much. I feel like the world can use some more swashbuckling, rollicking space adventures in all shapes and forms. I know I’d read those kinds of books all day long. But sci-fi is more or less doing what it’s always done, which is great. If it ain’t broke, after all. Still, I wouldn’t mind seeing some space carved out for these kinds of pulpy adventures. </p>\n<p><em>We are Mayhem</em> is due out in stores on April 9th, 2019. </p>",

In our biweekly column </em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/games/2018/1/21/16862992/short-play-indie-video-games\"><em>Short Play</em></a><em> we suggest video games that can be started and finished in a weekend.</em></p>\n<p>Cities at night can be magical. There’s a turning point, after all the late night people have gone home, before the early morning risers head to work, when things start to feel weird. Familiar places don’t become unfamiliar, exactly. But they do feel off. You’ll walk through someplace like Times Square, lit up like it’s trying to artificially appear as though its still daytime, but with no one around to see it.</p>\n<div><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/315328376?byline=0&badge=0&portrait=0&title=0\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p><em>Bird of Passage</em> doesn’t so much exist in this setting, but mine it for everything it’s worth. The game follows a... person? Bird? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasa-obake\">Eyeball umbrella</a>? As they wander lost from taxi ride to taxi ride through the late night streets of Tokyo. But all you see of the city is in the night lights reflected in the taxi, and the occasional sidewalk where our wandering protagonist is left by one cab before being quickly picked up by the next.</p>\n<p>The narrative unfolds in text through conversations that the unnamed protagonist has with the different drivers they encounter. Like a visual novel, you are given different dialogue options to choose from, that then take these conversations down different paths. Sometimes they provide insight into why the wanderer is so lost, or as to what they might actually be.</p>\n<p>Each taxi is different from the last, but as you play things become familiar. The look of the different sidewalks and taxis start to seem similar, but not exactly the same. A cyclical pattern occurs as the conversations with the cab drivers then start to repeat. In a sense this imitates the confused wanderings of this lost passenger, but it also lets you explore different dialogue options you hadn’t chosen earlier. Through this process you learn more about what the wanderer really is.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N0ING8tqvQG6Uc-9Xe2lNxYtJek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14732629/BirdOfPassage_2019_02_26_14_29_54.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>It’s a clever structure, as visual novels often require multiple playthroughs in order to see the full story, or unlock the real ending. <em>Bird of Passage</em> manages to find a way to fit that experience into a single session, while also tying it into the narrative. This is especially true after you’ve been through the cycle a few times, having seemingly run out of dialogue options and new paths for the story to go down. At this point you start trying to reconstruct in your head the different paths you’ve taken through the dialogue while working your way through the conversations again and again. </p>\n<p>In a way this structure mimics the experience of the wanderer in both their frustration and confusion as to how to get to where they are going when they don’t know where they need to be. As the player, this repetition doesn’t last long enough to become frustrating. But it’s long enough that you feel it, long enough that you start to empathize with the wanderer. So that when you’ve finally gotten all the information, and they’ve figured out where it is they’ve been trying to go, it makes that moment all the more powerful and a relief.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bird of Passage<em> was created by The Space Backyard.

Marla refused to let family time together feel too precious, too heightened, too sad.”</em></p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\">In his article, Mr. Mehlman talks about how grateful his children were that he and his wife hid her illness from them, on the basis that it would allow them more childhood “normalcy.” Having lived nearly the opposite experience, I would like to reassure both him and his readers that he is absolutely correct.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When I was 20, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She beat it, but the chemo irreparably damaged her arteries, to the point that the rest of her life was one of ongoing medical struggle. First came the wave of surgeries to install stents in all her major arteries. Then came the bypass surgeries. Next, one of the bypasses failed and spit out a blood clot that lodged below her left knee, and her lower leg had to be amputated. Then a bit more. Then a bit more. Then they took the knee. After that, her mobility went, and it was just a matter of time until a clot developed in the other leg. And so on and so forth.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003. She died in January 2018. At no time in the intervening period was she ever free of major medical complaints. As her only child and only surviving family, I loved her and supported her and helped her, but in the process I lost my mother. Having to deal with the various medical indignities and necessities rapidly ground away whatever semblance of the mother-child relationship we had, and replaced it with one of caregiver-patient.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Twenty isn’t young, but it’s still youthful. I was glad to have 16 more years with my mom, but if I could have had 14 of those years not knowing what she was dealing with, our relationship surely would have been different. And, I think, better. Had Mr. Mehlman’s daughters been subsumed in their mother’s medical needs from day one, they would still have mourned her when she died, but that mourning would have been tempered in a way that it should never be for a child.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Abraham Rash</strong><br><em>Montreal, Quebec, Canada</em></p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\">My wife and I did the very opposite of what the writer and his wife did. For us, our choice to reveal all to all interested parties has been exactly right. We enjoy the support, the cares, the prayers, and the companionship of a large community of loving people. For us to brave this terrible disease in private would have been to rob our children (about five years older than the author’s) and our other family and friends of an essential part of the human journey.</p><p><b>John F. Schuurman</b><br><em>Winfield, Ill.</em></p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\">A heart-wrenching story and one that brought back memories of my mother’s years fighting cancer when little was known of it. I was never told that it was life-threatening, and she lived and fought it for more years that I was ever aware of at the time. As late as one month before she died, she was making plans for things we would do in the near future as though nothing was wrong. I am grateful my parents never told me that she was dying so I could have an ordinary teen life without fear and worry of her dying so soon.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>James Brock</strong><br><em>Atlanta, Ga.</em></p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\">This article was not only heartbreaking to read but heartwarming at the same time. It gives me hope for the future. It shows me that even when faced with death, people still surprise us. It gave me strength and only supports the life I choose to live: one filled with love and passion for life and everyone around me. To not fear death and to welcome it with open arms when my time comes. To not leave anything unsaid. Thank you for sharing this story.</p><p><strong>Eli Vossler</strong><br><em>Portland, Ore.</em></p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\">My mother died of cancer when I was 12. Like the author of this story, my parents chose not to tell their children that she had limited time left. We were told she was sick but would get better.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I found out just how sick my mom was when an idling hearse woke me up one morning in July.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I have always felt cheated, wanting to better understand their decision and perhaps have a moment to say goodbye. This article helped me realize the gift my parents were trying to give.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tom Bauer</strong><br><em>Redondo Beach, Calif.</em></p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\">I have been an avid reader of <em>The Atlantic</em> for decades (I’m 72 years old). My wife is a breast-cancer survivor. I can honestly say that this is the very first time I was moved to tears reading an article. I just happen to have a soon-to-be-17-year-old daughter. Before my wife and I ever thought of being married, she was recovering from surgery and chemotherapy for breast cancer. She was told that she should not become pregnant, as estrogen would be a catalyst toward a reoccurrence of her cancer. She knew that she always wanted to have a child, but had resigned herself to adopting one. I never thought about having a child, but I told her that I would like to have one together. We decided to speak with her oncologist, who said that based on her positive recovery, we could have one child. We moved ahead with planning our wedding. We married on June 10, 2001. Our daughter was born on March 7, 2002. She was conceived on our honeymoon. This has been a total blessing for us. I realize that this was a positive outcome and that many are not so fortunate. However dire the prognosis, sometimes there are survivors. It’s important for one to understand one’s genetic predisposition for encountering this awful disease, but early detection can oftentimes increase one’s odds for survival and a meaningful recovery. This story reminded me of how fortunate we are. Thank you.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Robin </strong><b>Kingsbury</b><br><em>El Cerrito, Calif.</em></p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\">So many people are dealing with cancer in a spouse. We’ve come almost full circle from the days (1970s, I remember) when the word was taboo and people were afraid to talk about it. Now everyone talks about it—but maybe we’ve forgotten, or started to overlook, the option not to.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Karen Nyhus</strong><br><em>San Francisco, Calif.</em></p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\">Wow, did this article strike home for me. I am currently 20 months into battling ovarian, and it is proving to be a rather tenacious disease. I found this thoughtfully written, painfully honest, yet upbeat missive a combination of upsetting (as Marla eventually succumbed to the disease) and strangely empowering (as she did not do so easily). I found her perseverance and positivity, her desire to protect her children as long as possible (mine are adults, so it’s a different scenario), and her desire to live life to the fullest a good reminder to me to do the same. None of us is promised a tomorrow, but those of us fighting cancers (especially rare ones) have a shorter sell-by date.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Anne Coneys</strong><br><em>Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.</em></p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\">I am a medical oncologist and palliative-care physician who has focused on communication, and I was very interested in your recent article about how your wife disclosed her cancer to your children. The title, however, isn’t quite true to what your wife really did: She waited until a moment of her choosing to tell the children. She did not completely withhold this information, and it sounds like she was careful about the context and the message. It’s a wonderful story, and I wish my patients had more stories like this to read. But the title, I fear, misleads. There is a very important story in the very short paragraph where you describe how you told your children, and I hope that in the future you will tell that story, too. It would help a lot of families.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Anthony Back, M.D.</strong><br><em>Founder, VitalTalk<br>\nSeattle, Wash.</em></p><hr><p>I was once that child whose parents didn’t tell her that her father was dying. My dad was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer in October 2016. I was 19 years old. My parents kept the prognosis to themselves. I’m not quite sure why my sister (24 at the time) and I didn’t ask, but I’m very glad my parents kept it to themselves.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It was hard watching my dad go through treatments. He was also treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. God bless that place and the angels working inside of it. I watched my dad undergo chemotherapy for 48 hours straight every other week. At the time, I was attending college in New Hampshire. Yes, I sacrificed some class time to drive home to see my family, but it was nothing compared with what would have happened had my parents told me the truth.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Had I known my dad was dying, I would have stopped living. I would have dropped out of school and moved back home. I would have worried every second of every day. But that’s not what my parents wanted for me.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Because my parents kept the burden of the prognosis to themselves, I graduated college. Luckily for my family and me, my dad watched me walk across that stage, six months cancer-free. It wasn’t until October 19, 2017, that my parents told me my father should have died. He had a 30 percent chance to live the next three years. My parents lived with the thought of death hanging over their heads for a year while my sister and I lived normal lives. I commend you, Jon, for keeping that secret for seven years. Your girls are very lucky to have a father like you. May your wife rest in peace. She sounds like an amazing woman. She will live on each and every day through your daughters.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>MacKenzie Clarke</strong><br><em>Boston, Mass.</em></p><hr><p>Forty-seven years ago, my mother, who was 50 at the time, made the decision to keep her lung-cancer diagnosis and impending death a secret from me. I was in graduate school at the time and walked in her house and found her dying. She said, “I didn’t want to worry you.” Had I known, I probably would have left school and gone to be with her until she died. But learning of all this only 90 days before graduation, I chose to stay in school and finish my master’s. I have regretted all these years that I did not have time to get things settled with her before she died. Was her decision the right one? I don’t know. I had a great career and am now retired. I would not have had all this if I had left school to be at her side. But the ache is still there after all those years. This article is some solace to me. It gives voice to what my mother might have been thinking. Maybe it was a gift. It still hurts.<br><br><strong>Jay Whitcomb</strong><br><em>Ontario, Ore.</em></p><hr><h3>Jon Mehlman replies:</h3><p><em>I wish that responding personally to each of the letters that has been sent in response to our story was possible, and I hope readers know that I’ve read every one.

One of the studios behind the special effects, Pixomondo, has released a VFX breakdown that shows how one of the special effects studios created the futuristic, frozen Earth and its massive Earth engines. </p>\n<p>Since its release last month, the film has gone on to earn a <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/alita-battle-angel-wandering-earth-china-1203148402/\">staggering $641 million</a>, and has become the second-largest Chinese film to date. That’s a good sign for China’s domestic film market, which has been growing in recent years as more of its citizens go to the movies. </p>\n<p>This reel shows off that Pixomondo created much of the film’s numerous locations and features digitally — such as the massive Earth engines, a frozen Beijing, the massive vehicles that the characters drive around, and quite a bit more. Much of the film is digitally generated, showing just how far the industry has come. </p>\n<p>Pixomondo has worked on a wide range of films, from Chinese films like <em>Ice Fantasy </em>to<em> Flying over Jiangzi, </em>to US productions such as <em>Wonder Woman, Game of Thrones</em>, and more. <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI4NTIxOTE0NA==&mid=2247484423&idx=2&sn=2c26a52ff8f635563eb319aad645eda7&chksm=ebeec420dc994d360ace7787c464ce04fccda897d929d20b04ecda11c439ce03a712f17fec47&token=807510973&lang=zh_CN#rd\">In a post</a>, it explains that it was responsible for 216 shots in the film, which included assets for everything from the vehicles to environments, and prompted the company to “build an entirely new scene management pipeline and tools to handle the heavy workload for this project.”</p>\n<p>Having good special effects has long been a particular bottleneck for locally-produced science fiction films, as audiences have become accustomed to the level of quality seen in Hollywood releases. Chinese science fiction author and screenwriter Anna Wu told The Verge late last year that investors have been wary of producing big-budget science fiction films, because of that high bar — and there have been missteps along the way. Another film based on Cixin Liu’s (who also wrote <em>The Wandering Earth</em>) <em>The Three-Body Problem, </em>was produced, but has since sat on a shelf, its future uncertain. </p>\n<p>If you missed the film’s limited run in the US, you’ll soon be able to catch it on a screen near you: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234819/netflix-the-wandering-earth-china-science-fiction-blockbuster-cixin-liu-film\">Netflix recently picked up the rights</a> to stream the film. </p>",

There, the recently married 36-year-old wife of the chief British official, George Maclean, was found by her maid dead on the floor of her dressing room, an empty prescription bottle of highly toxic prussic acid in her hand. Nearby, probably in Accra, were the governor’s “country wife” and her several children; upon the new wife’s arrival from the literary precincts of London, they had been discreetly removed from the castle. Rumors would soon circulate in Britain that the governor’s previous consort was the murderer, though no evidence emerged to support those suspicions. On the desk was an unsent letter, banal and cheerful, rather than a suicide note.</p><p>The enigmatic celebrity death was of a piece with the life. Under the pen name “L.E.L.,” Letitia Elizabeth Landon had been one of the most famous literary women of her brief pre-Victorian moment, her poetry a staple of the popular literary press for well over a decade. A child of bourgeois-bohemian London, she had earned fame early on for her canny way of promising confessions that never quite materialized, lamenting all that she could not tell. She was a performer whose alluring mystery—constant hints and half-revelations—was her calling card. Was she the lovelorn maiden, virginal and yearning? The betrayed woman, experienced too soon? Was she sinner, victim, or the cynic playing at both poses? Even her several portraits look like different women.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"180\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/LEL_Book/e4301e26c.jpg\" height=\"266\"><figcaption>Knopf</figcaption></figure><p><i>L.E.L.: The Lost Life and Scandalous Death of Letitia Elizabeth Landon, the Celebrated “Female Byron”</i> is the first biography of Landon to explore recent revelations about her life, and the literary critic Lucasta Miller’s sleuthing delivers an unexpected result. The figure who emerges from her pages is not just a missing link in literary Romanticism, but a progenitor of something modern: Landon explored the art of performative self-creation in the commercial press—an art fated to become a habit in the social-media age—and she was one of the first to pay its costs. Neither sincere in a 19th-century sense nor confessional in a 20th-century one, L.E.L.’s signature style was a curiously opaque self-obsession.</p><p>She took the suffering of love as her consistent theme, but wrote with fluctuating tones. One note was the genuineness of her longing:</p><blockquote>Oh! say not, that for me more meet<br>\nThe revelry of youth;<br>\nOr that my wild heart cannot beat<br>\nWith deep devoted truth.</blockquote><p>Yet this could be followed by:</p><blockquote>He must be rich whom I could love,<br>\nHis fortune clear must be,<br>\nWhether in land or in the funds,<br>\n’Tis all the same to me.</blockquote><p>These verses were published in the same magazine on the same day in 1821, when she was 19. From the start, L.E.L. projected a public form of femininity by combining bold directness with a strange detachment. Intimations of some dark experience lurked in her verse. She seemed to crave public exposure and yet remained a cipher; hers was a voice seeking to escape the claustrophobia of solitude, yet prone to the agoraphobia that came of total visibility. No core self ever came into focus.</p><p>This was a mode of public personality inseparable from the commercial audience that consumed it, and the interest of Miller’s biography lies in watching a new form of self-presentation being invented by an unheralded young woman. The story Miller tells suggests that this mutable identity, scripted for mass consumption, was at its origin bound up with female experience: Its impetus, in L.E.L.’s pioneering case, was a distinctively female secret, one that we can now join a small group of Landon’s initial readers in knowing.</p><p><span>Starting in 1820, </span>Landon’s poetry appeared in <i>The Literary Gazette</i>, one of a new kind of magazine that emerged in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. Less overtly political than their predecessors, these publications flaunted their voguish instincts and aimed at mass readership. They adopted a self-referential stance of discussing the very notoriety they spread; they offered an insider’s guide to what we might now call celebrity culture and its secrets, in a lightly mocking tone that hailed literary, theatrical, and political notables with one hand while knocking them down with the other.</p><p>L.E.L.—revealed by an early editor’s note to be “a lady yet in her teens”—presented an especially fascinating mystery: How could a young female adopt, with a precocious knowingness, the erotic pessimism of late Romantics such as Byron, on display in verses like these of 1823?</p><blockquote>Twine not those red roses for me,—<br>\nDarker and sadder my wreath must be;<br>\nMine is of flowers unkissed by the sun,<br>\nFlowers which died as the Spring begun.<br>\nThe blighted leaf and the cankered stem<br>\nAre what should form my diadem.</blockquote><p>A voice like this invited both heartfelt identification and prurient attention. For readers of one kind (generally speaking, female and provincial), it conveyed the drama of an inner life stifled by a lack of expressive outlets. Charlotte and Emily Brontë, in their adolescence, were two such readers. Other readers (male, metropolitan) heard in the voice a code and a come-on, the sly declarations of someone they might meet, seduce, capture. If the poet had mysteries, they could learn them; desires, they could satisfy them. Edward Bulwer-Lytton, the future novelist, politician, colonial administrator, and peer, was one of these. He later remembered the craze of speculation that L.E.L. inspired: “Was she young? Was she pretty? and—for there were some embryo fortune-hunters among us—was she rich?”</p><p>Bulwer-Lytton, as it happened, ended up in Landon’s milieu and learned what would remain publicly unknown for generations to come: When the 20-year-old Landon wrote those lines in the spring of 1823—her bankrupt father having absconded and her family facing poverty—she was pregnant by <i>The</i> <i>Literary Gazette</i>’s married editor, William Jerdan, who had offered a financial lifeline by agreeing to publish her. That secret was rediscovered in 2000, when an American doctoral student named Cynthia Lawford revealed proof that Landon had given birth to three children by Jerdan in the 1820s. The children had been given up, and went on to lead lives of varying degrees of obscurity in Australia, Trinidad, and Britain. This was the shame the poetry hinted at.</p><p data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1869/09/the-true-story-of-lady-byrons-life/305445/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Harriet Beecher Stowe on the scandalous true story of Lady Byron’s life</a>]</i></p><p>The predatory Jerdan—Miller asserts that he fathered 23 children by multiple women—had tired of Landon by the early 1830s. But he did so only after having acted as her banker as well as her editor, appropriating much of her earnings in futile attempts to secure for himself an upper-bourgeois foothold. He may even have leveraged Landon’s secret: Henry Colburn, Jerdan’s creditor and also one of the <i>Gazette</i>’s owners, published in 1826 clever allusions to Landon’s pregnancies in other papers he owned, stoking the gossip around which her poetry delicately maneuvered. L.E.L. was a property, and making that property pay depended on careful manipulation of her hidden life.</p><p>Continually hard up, Landon tried every kind of commercial literary venture: not just poetry for magazines, but large amounts of verse for the newly popular “annuals”—luxe, kitschy illustrated gift books, such as one called <i>Fisher’s Drawing Room Scrap Book.</i> She even wrote “silver fork” novels about high-society life, such as 1831’s <i>Romance and Reality</i>, a melodrama of hopeless love that leads her young female protagonist from London drawing rooms to a Neapolitan convent and then to an early death. Landon’s own health was poor, and her world was small by necessity. Her doctor, for instance, was the<i> Gazette</i>’s medical columnist, an arrangement Jerdan may have made to reward him for his discretion. As the new proprieties of the early Victorian period descended, the titillating knowledge of Landon’s private life turned to mockery and distaste in the very literary circles that had initially fostered her celebrity. Anonymous letters ended a brief 1835 engagement to the law student and literary aspirant John Forster. As Landon entered her 30s, the calculated ambiguity that had made her name now threatened to undo her.</p><p>Finally, when the outsider Maclean entered her orbit in 1836, a network of friends and wealthy acquaintances colluded to marry her off and remove her to Africa. Like everything else in Landon’s story, profit was a primary motive. In dangling her before Maclean as a prospective famous spouse, one pivotal intermediary sought to gain a key commercial contact. The marriage spelled escape, but also exile. When news of her death reached Britain (Miller suggests suicide, either intentional or subconscious), this mercenary attitude switched to remorse—which expressed itself in the connivance of her memoirists, Jerdan among them, to remain silent about her true story. The move served as both self-protection and expiation. Landon was retroactively sanitized, repackaged as a virginal victim of her heart’s unrequited yearning. So she remained through the 20th century: an emblem of the insipid, the merely girlish. The upshot was that she became all the more forgettable, and gradually forgotten.</p><p data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-brontes-secret/480726/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The secret of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Brontë</a>]</i></p><p><span>Miller is a </span>debunker by temperament, fascinated by the space between image and truth in cultural history. <i>The Brontë Myth</i> (2001) charted with pugnacious glee the distortions by which Charlotte and Emily were turned into saintly mystics. Here is a case tailor-made for her: a story of exploitation in which cultural operators conspire to foster, manipulate, and then callously snuff out an artistic talent, lying all the while. That L.E.L.’s chosen metaphors—enslavement to passion, the melancholic will to self-erasure—had a perverse way of becoming reality lends an added frisson. Landon died, after all, in a castle built above former slaveholding dungeons. Miller is unafraid of anachronisms and applies them vividly. Jerdan’s sinister “grooming” of Landon was ignored by her indebted family members, who in their haste to benefit from her talents were not overscrupulous in protecting her. Euphemisms such as <i>protégée</i> tell only part of the tale: Landon was “pushed onto the casting couch” and did what was required.</p><aside data-source=\"curated\"></aside><p>Miller delves eagerly into the menacing, male-dominated world of magazines and publishers—the rooms filled with cigar smoke and raucous jokes, the leering family men, the camaraderie built on roguish convenience or bribery, the brutally shifting fortunes of editors and writers alike. Compared with the anodyne picture of the culture industry in most scholarship, Miller’s portrait is detailed and tenaciously cynical—and truer. In her hands, Landon’s story is a recognizably modern tragedy, that of the female artist forced to earn attention by reshaping her exploitation into a febrile glamour, knowing all the while that eventually titillation will become condemnation.</p><p>Why attend to Landon’s life now, other than as yet another story about the depredations of men who hold the levers of cultural power? The interest Landon holds for us lies in the tenuous autonomy she constructed for herself while in the grip of that machinery. Always Landon seems to be asking, <i>Why do I have </i>this<i> life? I didn’t choose it; it both is and isn’t my self.</i> The result was a manner that played with multiple poses, particularly male ones, such as Byronic melancholy and Keatsian sensuality—but remained detached from all of them. The style could be clichéd, as with her frequently lovelorn persona, acknowledging both the truth and the trap of clichés. It was offhand and urgent, somehow haunting and disposable at the same time. She wrote as if every utterance were set to auto-delete. The effect was to privilege the halting, sloppy, and incomplete self. The voice was a desperate and brilliant compromise with a voracious and invasive commercial culture, and its strategy has endured.</p><hr><p><small><em>This article appears in the April 2019 print edition with the headline “The Curated Self, Circa 1820.”</em></small></p><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/8PtdiIQW1VQ\" height=\"1\">",

There are a few friendly messages, but in the short time Expensive Chat has been operational, it’s become mostly littered with ads for companies and services.

Public chat rooms can quickly turn into overwhelming and chaotic spaces, so it’s interesting to see how people’s decisions change when every letter is tallied to a bill. Behavioral commentary aside, Köhlbrugge tells <em>Motherboard</em> the real reason he started it was simpler.

            "content": "<p>Law Professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. is among the most accomplished people at Harvard. He has helped to overturn scores of wrongful convictions and to free thousands from wrongful incarceration. A sought-after defense attorney and director of Harvard’s criminal law clinic, he became the first African American in the institution’s history to be appointed as a faculty dean, a pastoral role that includes residing at Winthrop House among its undergraduates. But a vocal faction of students now wants to force his resignation, an escalating controversy covered most thoroughly in <em>The Harvard Crimson</em>.</p><p>According to the <em>Crimson</em>, vandals <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/26/sullivan-throp-graffiti/\">spray-painted the doors</a> of Winthrop House this week with “Down w Sullivan!,” “Our Rage is Self Defense,” “Whose Side Are You On?,” and “Your Silence is Violence.” An online petition has circulated among those who want to end his role in residential life. Protesters <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/12/students-protest-sullivan-weinstein/\">assembled on campus</a> to publicly show their displeasure. And Harvard administrators launched a “climate review” among the undergraduates in his charge, <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/26/Winthrop-climate-review-sullivan/\">invoking procedures</a> for “when climate concerns arise in a faculty-led unit.”</p><p>Sullivan confronts this “<a href=\"http://www.famous-trials.com/massacre/199-diaryentry\">clamor of popular suspicions and prejudices</a>” because he agreed to act as a criminal defense attorney for an object of scorn and hatred: Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>His detractors should know that by undertaking to represent such a client Sullivan is participating in a tradition older than the nation itself. <span>The British soldiers who opened fire on a crowd of Bostonians in 1770, killing five, were among the most reviled men in the 13 colonies. Harvard alumnus John Adams, a patriot with aspirations for political office, agreed to defend them at trial, even though he knew that he was risking not only his reputation, but the safety of his family, because aggrieved Bostonians felt that <em>their</em> safety was implicated. </span></p><p>“In the Evening I expressed to Mrs. Adams all my Apprehensions: That excellent Lady, who has always encouraged me, burst into a flood of Tears, but said she was very sensible of all the Danger to her and to our Children as well as to me, but she thought I had done as I ought, she was very willing to share in all that was to come and place her trust in Providence,” he later wrote. Though he went on to sign the Declaration of Independence, and serve as vice-president and president of the United States, he counted bolstering the principle that even people accused of heinous crimes deserve a vigorous defense as “one of the most gallant, generous, manly and disinterested Actions of my whole Life, and one of the best Pieces of Service I ever rendered my Country.”</p><p>Throughout U.S. history, criminal defense attorneys have endeavored to conserve and apply that principle. And they’ve been subjected to attacks for so doing.</p><p>“Little more than half a century ago, mainstream lawyers were frightened away from defending alleged Communists who faced congressional witch hunts, blacklisting, criminal trials, and even execution,” Harvard Law’s Alan Dershowitz <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=zVIhAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=Sen.+Joseph+McCarthy+and+the+millions+of+Americans%E2%80%93%E2%80%93including+many+lawyers,+law+professors,+and+bar+association+leaders%E2%80%93%E2%80%93who+supported+this+attack+on+%E2%80%98communist+lawyers%E2%80%99+made+it+impossible+for+decent+lawyers+who+despised+communism+but+supported+civil+liberties+and+constitutional+rights+for+all+to+defend+accused+Communists+without+risking+their+careers&source=bl&ots=gT3gcdru8y&sig=ACfU3U07TjCPGuL9awjdfGUUYkl_5Fn2Rg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi-zvqQ-uLgAhWB4FQKHXwyAykQ6AEwCXoECBMQAQ#v=onepage&q=Sen.%20Joseph%20McCarthy%20and%20the%20millions%20of%20Americans%E2%80%93%E2%80%93including%20many%20lawyers%2C%20law%20professors%2C%20and%20bar%20association%20leaders%E2%80%93%E2%80%93who%20supported%20this%20attack%20on%20%E2%80%98communist%20lawyers%E2%80%99%20made%20it%20impossible%20for%20decent%20lawyers%20who%20despised%20communism%20but%20supported%20civil%20liberties%20and%20constitutional%20rights%20for%20all%20to%20defend%20accused%20Communists%20without%20risking%20their%20careers&f=false\">wrote</a>. “Sen.

(She thought he was guilty.) Defense attorneys for child predators make many feel angry and unsafe.  </p><p>Now Sullivan is defending a man who makes many at Harvard feel angry and unsafe. The Change.org petition started by a Harvard student and signed by scores more suggests that some are now disgusted by the dean and law professor.</p><p>As they <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/harvard-administration-students-for-the-removal-of-winthrop-dean-sullivan\">put it</a>:</p><blockquote>\n<p>For those of you who are members of Winthrop House, do you really want to one day accept your Diploma from someone who for whatever reason, professional or personal, believes it is okay to defend such a prominent figure at the centre of the #MeToo movement? Regardless of Dean Sullivan's intentions, his role as a community leader, and as someone who should first and foremost value the safety of the students he lives with in Winthrop House, should always come first … he should step down as Winthrop House Dean immediately.</p>\n</blockquote><p>These students may not realize it, but they are creating a disincentive for ambitious young legal academics to undertake the defense of any potentially controversial client, including indigent men who stand accused of rape or sexual assault. That raises the odds of wrongful convictions, especially among the poor.</p><p>Harvard religious studies professor Diana Eck took a more forgiving approach. She <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/02/12/harvard-harvey-weinstein-now-cause-for-concern/GXpf7wL9mbnWRTfLrfTrRM/story.html\">told the <em>Boston Globe</em></a> that defending unpopular clients is noble and “extremely important.”</p><p>Yet she went on to say that “for our part, we also expect there to be choices made in the interests of our students and the community of students that we try to nurture.”</p><p><span><em>If </em>there is an inherent tension between upholding an “extremely important” civic norm––legal representation for even the most reviled—and nurturing</span><span> undergraduates, it seems to me that Harvard ought to prioritize conserving the norm.</span> But is it <em>really</em> inherently “<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/1/editorial-sullivan-upholds-law-not-students/\">incongruous</a>” for Sullivan to defend a man like Weinstein in a criminal rape trial <em>and</em> endeavor to promote a safe environment for students, including victims of sexual assault, as a faculty dean?</p><p>Visiting Harvard Law Professor Catharine MacKinnon emailed:</p><blockquote>\n<p>The issue is not whether Ron can represent reviled clients accused of crimes and still be the faculty dean of a college. Of course he can. The issue is substantive: whether siding with a credibly accused multiple perpetrator of sexual assault is consistent with being the person to whom sexually abused students can feel comfortable confiding in, in an institutional position of reporting such abuse. This is an equality question for Ron to consider and also for the college to consider.</p>\n</blockquote><p>To me, Sullivan isn’t “siding with” Weinstein any more than liberal attorneys who represented members of Al Qaeda at Guantanamo Bay were “siding with the enemy.” (Had any of them been faculty deans at Harvard I doubt anyone would’ve felt unsafe confiding to them that a terrorist plot was afoot.) Nevertheless, the subjective feelings of students do have some relevance here.</p><p>As MacKinnon put it:</p><blockquote>\n<p>Under these conditions, the students are entitled, as they have said, not to feel safe reporting their abuse to him, resulting in compromised access to their education on the basis of sex. Whether this outcome is consistent with his role as Faculty Dean of a college is for Harvard to decide.</p>\n</blockquote><p>Students are indeed entitled to their feelings; and deans do serve at Harvard’s pleasure. But it isn’t clear to me that a student’s equal access to education is compromised by virtue of feeling uncomfortable reporting a sexual assault to a given dean, especially when there are many other Harvard officials to whom he or she can confide. In fact, Sullivan appointed Resident Dean Linda D.M. Chavers to serve “as the house’s ‘point person’ for sexual assault issues,” the <em>Crimson</em> <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/6/sullivan-winthrop-resources/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1551682614428000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG05eItYiBMfrLHMf6mxn9c2-E0Xw\" href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/6/sullivan-winthrop-resources/\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a>. “Students will also be able to seek assistance from house tutors—all of whom have been briefed on resources for sexual misconduct issues—and … the Dean of Students Office and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.”</p><p><em>The Harvard Crimson’s</em> editorial board put its case against Sullivan <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/1/editorial-sullivan-upholds-law-not-students/\">this way</a>:</p><blockquote>\n<p>We condemn his choice to represent Weinstein and urge him to address the tension between the two roles more directly than he previously has. As faculty dean, Sullivan has a primary responsibility to his students, namely in representing Winthrop House and fostering a “<a href=\"https://osl.fas.harvard.edu/house-staff\">close-knit community</a>” within the College. This includes upholding the College’s efforts to combat sexual assault on campus. By choosing to represent Weinstein, Sullivan has jeopardized his ability to keep the trust of an alarmingly large group of students.</p>\n</blockquote><p>One powerful retort to that way of thinking <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/02/12/harvard-harvey-weinstein-now-cause-for-concern/GXpf7wL9mbnWRTfLrfTrRM/story.html\">appeared</a> in the <em>Boston Globe,</em> which in its coverage of the controversy quoted a Harvard Law grad taught by Sullivan:</p><blockquote>\n<p>“Do you really think that lawyers are an extension of the criminals they represent?” she asked. The woman … said Sullivan advocated for her personally, encouraged her to pursue an assault charge, and offered to handle her case pro bono. He has done the same for other women at Harvard, she noted, often taking up the case of the accuser rather than the accused.</p>\n<p>And, she noted, in law school he was known for encouraging students to practice both sides—as prosecutor and defense—often trading the roles himself. “It’s completely flawed to suggest that attorneys can’t step into and out of roles and representations and keep them separate,” said the woman, who went on to become a sex crimes prosecutor.</p>\n</blockquote><p>The woman’s account suggests that Sullivan <em>does</em> deserve the trust of victims and underscores the dubiousness of judging him on the basis of a single client he represents in a career full of them rather than his behavior over decades in academic life.</p><p>Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig echoed the argument that it’s possible to be a survivor of sexual assault and yet feel comfortable with Sullivan’s choice.</p><p>“I was <a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/12061/\">raped repeatedly</a> as a boy,” he wrote me. “I would have no problem with Sullivan representing the man who raped me. That’s because I have a clear sense of how vicious and arbitrary the criminal justice system can be. That knowledge leads me to believe that we should encourage adequate representation, not scorn excellent representatives. Defending a criminal defendant is not to defend a crime. That understanding is fundamental to a just criminal justice system.”</p><p>A less personal retort, this one responding directly to the <em>Crimson </em>editorial, was offered in an unpublished letter to the editor shared with me by Harvard Law Professor Randall Kennedy. He rejected the notion that there is an incongruity between defending a man accused of sexual misconduct as an attorney and promoting a comfortable environment for undergraduates as a faculty dean. “The skills, capacities, and dispositions that would help to make a person a valued defense counsel are also the skills, capacities, and dispositions that would help to make a person a valued Faculty Dean,” he argued. “These features include poise, close listening, mastery of relevant information, and a willingness and ability to safeguard the rights of all sorts of people, including outsiders, the ostracized and, indeed, the villainous.” He proceeded to ask:</p><blockquote>\n<p>The position advanced by the Editorial Board would presumably disqualify <u>any</u> lawyer who represents or has represented people accused of sex offenses.</p>\n<p>Does that mean that a latter day Bella Abzug or Thurgood Marshall would be disqualified as a prospective Faculty Dean?  Both represented defendants charged with rape.</p>\n</blockquote><p>Writing in <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em> on the same subject, Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/When-a-Dean-Defends-Harvey/245800\">mused</a> that this episode “<span>displays the intensity of the anger at sexual malfeasance and the institutional indifference that has allowed such misconduct.” He asserted—and I concur—that “anger is warranted” as “sexual harassment and assault are all too prevalent and prohibitions against them remain all too ineffective.” And he urged overdue reforms. Yet he cautioned that “</span><span>anger, untethered from principles, is sometimes woefully misguided.” </span></p><p><span>Computer Science Professor Harry Lewis <a href=\"http://harry-lewis.blogspot.com/\">adds</a> that residential life at Harvard ought to teach “</span>how to engage in a spirit of civic optimism with people whose decisions and actions you find disagreeable.” He thinks a society in which members play multiple roles “holds together peacefully and productively only through the exercise of reason applied to deep but sometimes competing commitments to individual freedom and to the common good,” requiring “sublimation of one’s own emotions... empathy toward others...” and rejecting the view “that discord is intolerable and personal comfort is supreme.”</p><p>More than any student discord, I was alarmed by the administration’s decision to investigate the “climate” at Winthrop House in response to this controversy (and perhaps also fallout from Sullivan’s <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/4/sullivan-defends-freyer/\">defense</a> of <a href=\"https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2019/01/27/harvard_the_new_york_times_and_the_metoo_takedown_of_a_black_academic_star.html\">a colleague accused of sexual harassment</a>). Rachael Dane, Director of Media Relations for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard, took issue with my use of the word “investigation” in an email correspondence. She wrote: “<span>I think it is important to emphasize that we are not undertaking an investigation. We are using ordinary processes to collect information from the entire Winthrop Community.” </span></p><p>Harvard Professor Jeannie Suk Gersen emailed me her concerns with such “processes”:</p><blockquote>\n<p>Professor Sullivan has chosen to represent and defend persons whom many people would not defend. Strong disagreement with those choices is of course part of the exploration of differences of principle and opinion that we’d hope for in a university. That is not shocking or troubling, and a university should support that debate. What <em>is </em>shocking is that Harvard is undertaking an official “review” of the “climate” arising from Professor Sullivan’s professional choice to represent particular clients. The review is not based on an allegation that Professor Sullivan has violated any university policy.</p>\n<p>It is based on some students’ demands that Professor Sullivan be removed as faculty dean because they are disturbed and distressed by his professional choice.</p>\n<p>Announcing a “climate review” holds out a not at all veiled threat of removal from the faculty dean position based on what the climate review will reveal.  We can kid ourselves that this is simply about a resident dean position that is “pastoral,” and that the university would of course not proceed this way regarding regular teaching faculty positions. But that distinction is illusory, since faculty members are also mentors, advisors, role models, and supportive figures, who, by virtue of their position, are part of the Title IX reporting apparatus.</p>\n<p>Faculty members are now on notice that based on positions we take, clients we represent, or causes we speak out on, our university may determine that the “climate” is so negatively affected by some students’ reaction to work that it must take “action,” perhaps including removal. What are the chances that, seeing this, other faculty will dare defend such a reviled person or make a highly controversial argument inviting blowback, if there’s a real chance of triggering an official “climate review”? We are witnessing a major illiberal turning point in universities, but this moment is remarkable because it’s the Harvard administration acting in its official capacity, not just some stray voices.</p>\n</blockquote><p>Harvard Professor Janet Halley called Harvard’s actions “deeply disturbing.” She explained in an email:</p><blockquote>\n<p>The right to counsel even for the most despised defendants, the basic role of counsel in our legal order, the presumption of innocence, academic freedom, and the right of University employees to assist persons accused in the University’s Title IX proceedings—are all implicated here.  A small minority of students has asked the University to throw all these fundamental values out the window; it is deeply shocking to watch University administrators accede to these demands.  Finally, the “climate survey” technique is a dangerous precedent as a matter of employment rights and as a threat to academic freedom.  It’s a thinly veiled version of the heckler’s veto. The space for genuine intellectual controversy within the Harvard community has been narrowed by the University’s cowardly proceedings in this case.    </p>\n</blockquote><p>Harvard Law Professor Scott Westfahl, however, defended the idea of a “climate” review, also by email:</p><blockquote>\n<p>I don’t think the ‘climate’ review meaningfully threatens defense attorneys generally or related social norms. As an educator, I see this as a great teaching moment that will hopefully help our community appreciate that from John Adams, Harvard Class of 1755, to Ron Sullivan, Harvard Law Class of 1994, we have produced graduates who courageously advocate for the accused even when it is most unpopular to do so.</p>\n</blockquote><p>In his view, “We are all better off as a result,” and he noted, “I completely support the right of Professor Sullivan, an extremely talented defense lawyer, to take on a very difficult case. Should Mr. Weinstein be convicted, there will be absolutely no doubt that he received a fair hearing with the best possible defense counsel.” He added that he draws a distinction between representing Weinstein at trial and hiring investigators for Weinstein, as previous attorneys did. There’s a difference, he noted, “between fact-finding and unethical intimidation.”</p><p>Neither Harvard Dean Claudine Gay nor Dean Rakesh Khurana wanted to comment for this article, and an attempt to reach President Lawrence Bacow failed.</p><hr><p>There’s more at issue here than the idea that every accused criminal, no matter how heinous, deserves a zealous defense.</p><ul><li>Victims of a given crime are not rendered “unsafe” or re-victimized by mere proximity to an attorney who has defended someone accused of that crime.</li>\n<li>Representing clients accused of heinous crimes does not render a lawyer unable to provide “pastoral guidance.” (Students can of course choose to ignore or avoid guidance from people whose moral intuitions and values differ from their own.)</li>\n<li>Harvard faculty members who are also defense attorneys should not be subject to “climate” investigations just because they represent unpopular clients.</li>\n</ul><p>Harvard should of course tolerate the viewpoints that a defense attorney who represents a heinous criminal is therefore creepy, or acquires the stink of the attendant crime, or cannot be trusted to counsel and mentor undergraduate students. And liberals should be forgiving of undergraduates who toy with those civically dangerous positions as they wrestle with a fraught subject that even adults who know better find hugely challenging to confront with circumspection.</p><p>But Harvard should never adopt those viewpoints, and should teach students why generations of principled attorneys suffered and sacrificed to oppose them. Even those who seek to exclude defense attorneys from polite society are not necessarily bad people. But they fail to grasp how much they risk as they work to further weaken the norm against punishing the lawyers of the reviled.</p><p>As Andrew W. Liang <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/1/liang-i-applaud-sullivan/\">put it</a> in the <em>Crimson, </em>if enough attorneys “feel the need to think twice… there will be no distinction between a trial by public opinion and a trial in a court of law. The onslaught of negative publicity for a lawyer will be so costly that few good attorneys will want to defend those who—for one reason or another—have been presumed guilty by a public majority. Such individuals will find no advocate… and the integrity of our legal system will cease to exist.”</p><p><em>Emails responding to this article from any perspective are encouraged—write to conor@theatlantic.com and note if you don’t want your name shared if your letter is published.</em></p><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/-wMQzFDU0hA\" height=\"1\">",

            "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are three things you should know about Huey Long: He served as first the governor and then a senator for Louisiana in the late 1920s and early 1930s. While in office, he pursued a populist agenda by aggressive means that many critics saw as autocratic and unlawful. And he held on to popular support, in spite of the critics, right up until one of them killed him.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In an <em>Atlantic</em> article written two months after Long was assassinated in 1935, <a href=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/files/nov_1935_-_sokolsky_-_huey_long.pdf\">George Sokolsky remembered</a> having asked Long if he was a fascist. “Fine,” Long told him in a conversation that took place less than a year before he was killed. “I’m Mussolini and Hitler rolled into one. Mussolini [force-fed dissidents] castor oil; I’ll give them tabasco, and then they’ll like Louisiana.” Then he laughed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The accusation of fascism was nothing new for Long. He was a controversial figure in American politics, attracting a passionate base of support on one hand for effectively pushing progressive legislation and widely condemned on the other for alleged corruption and abuses of power. Rather than denying these allegations outright, Long tended to play them off, as he did to Sokolsky. “I used to get things done by saying please,” he said after the state senate tried, and failed, to impeach him in 1929. “That didn’t work and now I am a dynamiter.” Then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt regarded him as “one of the two most dangerous men in America.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Few American politicians have provoked such devotion and recrimination at the same time. But Long has one notable modern counterpart: Donald Trump. In many ways, his final years paralleled Trump’s 2016 campaign and presidency. Both men rose to national political prominence in the aftermath of a global financial crisis, with ethnic violence on the rise, automation putting workers’ jobs in doubt, and autocratic leaders gaining political power worldwide. Both made waves with sweeping populist rhetoric and policy proposals that challenged their parties’ more moderate establishments and promised to make government work for the common people. Both encapsulated their pledge to elevate the nation in a catchy slogan: Trump’s “Make America Great Again” and Long’s “Every Man a King.” And both, once in power, showed little concern for norms and standard legislative procedures when pursuing their goals.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But while Trump ran on a reactionary brand of populism, blending anti-establishment rhetoric and promises to restore prosperity and order with appeals to racist and nativist anxiety, Long pursued a progressive agenda and steered clear of the race-baiting common in Southern politics at the time. In this sense, Long is an interesting foil for Trump, who registered as a Democrat at several points in his life and expressed support for some typically Democratic policies even as he turned to the right. Though he died before he could run for president, much less take office, Long’s brief political career provides a mirrored vision of Trump’s demagogic populism—a glimpse of what could happen if a left-wing politician channeled a similar message and disregard for political mores.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Much of the appeal of that kind of populism cuts across eras and party lines. Mark Brewer, a professor of political science at the University of Maine, identifies several factors that have led American populism to gain traction in certain moments, regardless of political affiliations: perceived conflict between “elites” and “common people”; a sense of economic unfairness; distrust of centralized authority, particularly the federal government; and a desire to “maintain a previously existing arrangement that’s under threat and, in a lot of cases, probably gone already.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Throughout American history, he says, populist voters have felt “a sense of a loss of control about what was going on in their society. Things were happening and things were changing, and the change was unsettling, but they couldn’t do anything about it. It was almost like they were being acted on from above.” That feeling has engendered the rise of parties and leaders, conservative or progressive, that promise to fight the system on behalf of average Americans.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Huey Long pledged to do just that throughout his contentious political career, and often delivered. While Trump has most aggressively leveraged his executive powers to manifest the anti-immigration plank in his populist platform, introducing a “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/trump-travel-ban/540912/?utm_source=feed\">Muslim ban</a>,” <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/09/trump-ice/565772/?utm_source=feed\">radicalizing ICE</a>, and, most recently, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/trump-emergency-declaration/582904/?utm_source=feed\">declaring a national emergency</a> in order to fund a border wall, Long used his authority to establish public works programs for the poor. In his four-year tenure as the governor of Louisiana, Long built an extensive network of highways and bridges through the isolated rural areas of the state, expanded lower-class access to health care and education, and implemented strict new regulations in the state banking industry that improved consumer protections.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After reaching the Senate in 1933, he pushed to implement a similarly progressive agenda on a federal level. Feeling that the New Deal was too moderate, he introduced a more radical alternative called the Share Our Wealth program, which would limit personal assets and earnings for the wealthiest Americans and redistribute money to guarantee a partial annual income to every family, fund old-age pensions for every senior, improve pensions and healthcare benefits for every veteran, and make a free college education and vocational training available to every student. Much of his vision remains an unrealized dream for progressives in the present day.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">His efforts to fight poverty, rooted in his own lower-class upbringing, endeared him to poor voters and secured the support of his base from the beginning. “All the forces of the Federal Government … cracked down on him,” Sokolsky wrote. “He held because he gave people schools and roads and jobs and money; because he relieved the lower strata of the heaviest burdens of taxation; because he made it possible for the poor to vote. The sum total of Huey’s administration was that it accomplished something constructive.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But in pursuit of those ends, Long worked to consolidate and expand his power by means that many felt were authoritarian. He gained a reputation for punishing political opponents early in his career, firing hundreds of bureaucrats and civil servants at every level of the Louisiana state government who didn’t support him and replacing them with people who did in the days after he took over the governorship. When politicians or institutional leaders opposed his agenda, he blocked funding and authorization for programs they wanted, ousted their family members from government jobs, and targeted them with retributive legislation. Incensed by negative coverage in the press, he founded his own newspaper. Later he co-founded an oil company, extending his powers of patronage beyond politics and into industry. Even after joining the Senate, he continued pushing bills through the Louisiana state legislature and retaliating against enemies and promoting supporters using his personal connections and state funding.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">These tactics, <a href=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/files/april_1933_-_kent_-_our_political_monstrosities.pdf\">Frank R. Kent summarized</a> in a 1933 <em>Atlantic</em> article, “enabled Huey to win the battles waged against him, to save himself by a hair from impeachment, to elect himself to the Senate, to substitute a creature of his own to succeed him as Governor, to elect his personal counsel as his Senatorial colleague, to dominate all but one of the Louisiana House delegation, to force the publisher of one of the hostile New Orleans newspapers to eat out of his hand—in short, to reduce his opponents, who include the best people in the state, to a condition of complete impotence.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Long was neither the first nor the last American populist leader to display authoritarian tendencies. In the 1830s, Andrew Jackson was dubbed King Andrew the First because of his liberal use of executive power. At the same time Long was amassing political capital, the Catholic priest and radio personality Charles Coughlin used his platform to promote fascism and racism to his listeners. In the 1960s, the Alabama governor George Wallace infamously blocked the racial integration ordered by the Supreme Court with his own body. Today Trump is attempting to circumvent Congress’s authority over the federal budget by claiming <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/?utm_source=feed\">emergency powers</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For Long, those tendencies ultimately spelled a death sentence: He was assassinated at the age of 42 by the son-in-law of a political opponent he was attempting to oust from office. He never ascended to the White House. No progressive populist like him ever has.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But that might change. Even as right-wing populism has gained power in recent years through Tea Party politicians and Trump, left-wing populism has also resurged. Earlier this decade, Occupy Wall Street launched mass protests and popularized the dichotomy of the 99% and the 1%. In the 2016 presidential primaries, Bernie Sanders won millions of votes in a campaign fueled by small-money donors and full of populist rhetoric. Some of Long’s radical progressive goals, like free college and universal basic income, have become more mainstream within the contemporary Democratic Party.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“We don’t know where Long would have ended up,” Brewer says. “Certainly, the assassin’s bullet stopped him short of where he wanted to go.” Long was an aggressive and popular proponent of progressive ideas still less than halfway through his first term in the Senate; he could have pushed the Democratic Party further left, if he hadn’t made too many enemies along the way. As Sokolsky wrote, “Huey Long never could have been elected President of the United States, but he forced one President to adopt an absurd fiscal program, and succeeded in balancing the political scale so accurately that he was, after Franklin D. Roosevelt, the most significant political personality of his day.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But he was also a staunch isolationist and an autocratic hoarder of power. As first World War II and later the Cold War and the civil-rights movement came to dominate American politics, the country’s populism grew more reactionary and nationalist. Gerald L. K. Smith, the man who co-founded the Share Our Wealth Party with Long, went on to lead the isolationist, racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-immigrant America First Party. Long’s abrupt and early death makes it unclear what path he would have taken, or what his aggressive brand of progressive politics would have looked like given more federal power, and more time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If left-wing populism continues to gain traction within the Democratic Party, it could become more clear what that power would look like—with or without Long’s particular edge of authoritarianism.</p><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/_Hd8xoaLmS0\" height=\"1\">",
