The individuals were never notified that their phones were being tapped, despite a law requiring such notice within 90 days of the wiretap’s conclusion, and were never charged with any wrongdoing.<br><br>EFF and Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton LLP represent a targeted individual whose phone was ordered tapped by Judge Helios J. Hernandez. The judge authorized a record number of wiretaps during the 2015 calendar year, not a single one of which resulted in either a trial or conviction. After a <u><a rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/11/dea-wiretap-operation-riverside-california/75484076/\">series of stories in USAToday</a> </u>uncovered Riverside County’s massive surveillance campaign and questioned the legality of the surveillance, watchdogs warned that the wiretaps likely violated federal law.<br><br>EFF Criminal Defense Attorney Stephanie Lacambra will argue that the wiretap order and justification should be subjected to public scrutiny and oversight because of the questionable circumstances surrounding its ssuance.

That probably explains the unusual three-lens front facing camera module you can see in the above images — and why it’s still got a notch <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18176129/honor-view-20-huawei-hole-punch-display-ces-2019\">in the new era of snazzier hole-punch displays </a>that don’t take up so much real estate.</p>\n<div><aside><q>And yes, it looks like there’s still a headphone jack</q></aside></div>\n<p>Blass has a reliable track record for leaked phone pics, but what gives these ones even more credibility is that they line up with two others, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/25/18197702/lg-g8-thinq-leak-render-no-earpiece-four-cameras\">the renders shared by @onleaks and @91mobiles last month</a> — who, unlike Blass, are known for producing their own renders based on leaked CAD blueprints for the phones. </p>\n<p>At the time, LG Electronics’ global comms head Ken Hong tweeted that the Onleaks images were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/visitken/status/1086051792444477440\">“only a speculative rendering,”</a> which is technically true. But unless LG’s been planting fakes, it looks like the speculation might have been pretty spot-on about the G8. And that doesn’t entirely hurt LG, considering it needs to build up a head of steam to compete with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/1/18206895/samsung-galaxy-s10e-lite-image-leak\">Samsung’s extensively leaked Galaxy S10 lineup</a>, which is slated to be announced on February 20th. (We’ll be there.)</p>\n<p>Other rumored LG G8 tidbits: Onleaks also suggested that the G8’s screen might vibrate to produce sound, and <em>CNET</em> recently reported that the G8 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/16/18186058/lg-g8-second-screen-attachement-mwc-2019\">will come with a special case attachment</a> that gives it a second screen. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/31/18204999/lg-v50-g8-mobile-world-congress-mwc-5g-rumor\">There’s also a rumor</a> that LG might launch a new flagship, the LG V50, alongside the G8 next month. </p>\n<p>Because LG’s V-series phones are its true flagships, after all. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17933558/lg-v40-thinq-review-cameras-5-features-battery-screen-photo-quality\">Here’s our review of the three-camera V40</a>, which gives you some idea where the G8 and the V50 are starting from.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update, 9:05 PM ET:</strong></em><em> Clarified that XDA-developers also shared what appears to be a near-identical picture of the phone, minus top and bottom angles, last month.</em></p>",

Temperatures climb, precipitation shifts, and the Charlotte, North Carolina of the future winds up feeling more like the Tallahassee, Florida of today. </p>\n<p>The map, released today along with a study in <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-019-08540-3\" target=\"_blank\">the journal <em>Nature Communications</em></a><em>, </em>forecasts the future climates for 540 cities in North America — connecting them to climates that we know. So instead of just saying that San Francisco, for example, will be 6.9℉ warmer and 40 percent drier than it is today, the map draws a line to the closest climate analogy, which, in this case, is a city in LA County.</p>\n<div><aside><q>“The goal was to try and translate these abstract, descriptive future projections.”</q></aside></div>\n<p>The point was to apply the facts of climate change to people’s everyday lives, says <a href=\"https://www.umces.edu/matt-fitzpatrick\">Matthew Fitzpatrick</a>, an ecologist at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science and one of the two authors on the study. Numbers on their own can be hard to grasp. “The goal was to try and translate these abstract, descriptive future projections into something that’s more local and more related to personal experience,” Fitzpatrick told <em>The Verge. </em></p>\n<p>So Fitzpatrick and his co-author Robert Dunn investigated how local climates could shift if fossil fuel emissions continue unchecked, <em>or</em> if we manage to cut back on our carbon emissions. Then they used statistics to find the closest locations with current climates that matched those future projections. On the map you can either see the average of the 27 different forecast scenarios the authors used, or look at the 27 individual lines. Interestingly, the forecasts don’t always agree. </p>\n<p>That means that for some places, the temperature and precipitation could change in ways we haven’t seen in North America. “It really underscores this dramatic transformation of climate that could occur over the next 60 years, in the lifetime of children alive today,” Fitzpatrick says. </p>\n<p>It’s not the first time we’ve seen maps of changing climates, as other places, <a href=\"https://earther.gizmodo.com/by-the-end-of-the-century-san-franciscos-climate-could-1832559738\">including Earther</a>, have noted. Climate Central, for example, has been charting the changes in <a href=\"http://medialibrary.climatecentral.org/resources/future-summers-in-your-city\">future summers around the country</a> for awhile. What <em>is </em>new is the slick new website, says <a href=\"https://atmo.tamu.edu/people/faculty/desslerandrew.html\">Andrew Dessler</a>, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&amp;M University. “It’s really a good idea — good visuals help make the case and help really make it clear to people what’s happening.” </p>\n<div><aside><q>“People can’t imagine how bad it’s going to get.” </q></aside></div>\n<p>Still, Dessler’s not optimistic that it will spur climate action. Even if people recognize the facts of climate change, it can be hard for people to think about solutions when they’re worrying about their kids or paying the rent, he says. “Along with insect apocalypse and nuclear war, it just doesn’t rise to the level of these other things,” Dessler says. “People can’t imagine how bad it’s going to get.” </p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WeatherProf?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Jeff Berardelli</a>, a meteorologist and climate communicator who also wasn’t involved in the study, thinks this is another tool that can <em>help</em> people imagine that future. “Understanding that the climate is changing doesn’t really get to the bottom of what that really means to people and their lives going forward,” he says. “Everybody probably has a unique way in which they can be reached through climate change communication, and this is another tool in our box.” </p>",

In one word: China. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/LegereJ_Testimony2.pdf\">In prepared remarks</a>, T-Mobile CEO John Legere ties the proposed merger to “American innovation and national security,” and specifically argues that the merger will be necessary to make the United States a leader on next-generation 5G network technology. “The stakes are high — nothing less than preserving our edge in innovation and maintaining our security,” he plans to say. </p>\n<p>The CEO plans to say that the US is “falling behind” China on 5G, which he says “has taken a global lead in the race.” He says in the remarks that only a newly merged T-Mobile will be able to compete. </p>\n<div><aside><q>“The stakes are high”</q></aside></div>\n<p>A representative for the Rural Wireless Association, which represents small carriers and counts Chinese company Huawei as a member, <a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/BennetC_Testimony.pdf\">plans to say</a> that T-Mobile and Sprint “have significant ties” to Chinese companies. In prepared remarks, Legere disputed that connection, saying that T-Mobile, like other major carriers, doesn’t use Huawei equipment in its network. “And we will never use it in our 5G network,” his remarks read.</p>\n<p>Sprint’s executive chairman does not mention Huawei in <a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/ClaureM_Testimony.pdf\">his prepared remarks</a>, although he makes a similar case about 5G in the United States, saying the merger “is about ensuring that the United States leads in the next generation of innovation, which will rely on the massive capacity that 5G can unleash.”</p>\n<p>Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18214166/huawei-security-china-fcc-5g-cybersecurity\">faced increasing scrutiny</a> in recent months, as US lawmakers have branded them security threats. Huawei has repeatedly denied that it would spy for the Chinese government.</p>\n<p>The planned testimony tomorrow will also focus on what the deal will mean for consumers. The merger will require approval from the FCC and Justice Department, but some consumer advocates have fought against the idea, pitched by T-Mobile and Sprint, that a merger will benefit consumers. A representative for Public Knowledge, a group critical of the deal, <a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Berenbroick_Testimony.pdf\">plans to call the merger</a> “a bad deal for consumers, competition, and America’s wireless future.” </p>",

Huffman is suing games publisher Activision for allegedly putting his comic book character “G.I. Bro” in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</em>. Huffman <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F399505362%2FBooker-T-vs-Activision\" target=\"_blank\">filed a copyright complaint</a> today based on similarities between G.I. Bro and the <em>Black Ops </em>character David “Prophet” Wilkes. “They could have drawn him any way they wanted. But they chose to steal Booker T’s ‘G. I. Bro,’” the complaint reads.</p>\n<p>Huffman’s lawsuit seems based essentially on visual similarities between G.I. Bro and Prophet. (That’s G.I. Bro as depicted in Huffman’s comic book <em>G.I. Bro and the Dragon of Death</em>, as opposed to his 1990s “G.I. Bro” wrestling persona, and Prophet as depicted in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</em>, as opposed to an older version of the character in <em>Black Ops III.</em>) Specifically, it compares a picture of Huffman’s character with a promotional image of Prophet, stating that “there is no doubt that [Activision] copied ‘G.I. Bro.’”</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"G.I.

Bro vs. Prophet</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The complaint describes Huffman’s character, which is based on his old alter ego, as “a retired special operations soldier, fighting an old enemy he thought he had finished off years before, with the support of his old military friends.” Prophet, a multiplayer “specialist” character in <em>Black Ops 4, </em>is a cybernetically enhanced soldier who eventually replaces most of his body parts with mechanical upgrades. While the two men sound almost nothing alike, at least a couple of Redditors have commented that Prophet <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackops4/comments/8ntef0/prophet_isnt_bald_anymore_has_dreads_now_and/\">looked like Booker T</a>.</p>\n<p>Huffman isn’t the first celebrity to sue over having their alleged likeness in a video game. Lindsay Lohan famously sued Rockstar Games over a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> character she claimed had been <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12777204/lindsay-lohan-grand-theft-auto-5-lawsuit-thrown-out\">based on her</a>, but a court <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/lindsay-lohan-loses-yet-again-in-grand-theft-auto-v-law-1824208563\">shot down the complaint</a>.

And the president isn’t thrilled: During a Cabinet meeting today, he told reporters that he was “not happy” with the deal and didn’t confirm whether he would sign the new compromise before Friday.

That’s because Vizio has settled a $17 million lawsuit for allegedly spying on what you’ve been watching — and it’s telling you how to get your money <em>by controlling your TV</em>, because that isn’t ironic or creepy in the least.

It allegedly tracked data by default, made tracking difficult to turn off, and compared those streaming habits against your age and gender to target you with ads. In 2016, some customers filed a class-action lawsuit against the company and in 2017, the FTC fined Vizio $2.2 million as well. </p>\n<p>Last year, Vizio settled the lawsuit portion for $17 million, and that’s where the payout is coming from.

It also said it would change the opt-out language to “accept/decline” rather than “accept/settings,” so that users could more clearly decline to have their data tracked if desired.</p>\n<p>Even though Vizio is notifying users about the settlement, it maintains its innocence, saying, “Vizio denies these allegations.

            "content": "<p>In January, <em>The Atlantic </em>published <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/bryan-singers-accusers-speak-out/580462/?utm_source=feed\">an investigation</a> into several allegations of sexual misconduct against the filmmaker Bryan Singer, who’s directed many blockbusters in his long career, including the recent box-office sensation <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/11/bohemian-rhapsody-review/574561/?utm_source=feed\"><em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em></a>. The news reverberated throughout Hollywood. But one producer who seemed untroubled was Avi Lerner. As the CEO of Millennium Films, Lerner was responsible for high-budget shlock such as the <em>Expendables </em>series, <em>Olympus Has Fallen </em>and its sequels, and an upcoming remake of <em>Red Sonja</em>, which had just hired Singer for a <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bryan-singer-nabs-huge-payday-directing-red-sonja-1148877\">reported $10 million</a>. This week, <em>Deadline</em> <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/02/bryan-singer-red-sonja-halted-bohemian-rhapsody-director-controversy-1202554558/\">reported</a> that the film was being moved to the “back burner” and taken off Millennium’s development slate.</p><p>Singer has dismissed the <em>Atlantic</em>’s story as a “homophobic smear piece,” calling the accusations “bogus.” Lerner backed him up in a January 24 <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/bryan-singer-red-sonja-directing-accusations-1203117341/\">statement</a>, saying, “I know the difference between agenda-driven fake news and reality, and I am very comfortable with this decision. In America people are innocent until proven otherwise.” Less than three weeks later, things have changed: On Monday, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/02/bryan-singer-red-sonja-halted-bohemian-rhapsody-director-controversy-1202554558/\"><em>Deadline </em>reported</a> that <em>Red Sonja </em>is being taken out of active development by its studio, which had been planning to start production in Europe later this year. Perhaps Singer’s reputation in Hollywood has now become too toxic even for Millennium Films. (Lerner was not immediately available for comment.)</p><p>For years, rumors had swirled in the industry about alleged sexual misconduct by Singer (fueled by <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/1997/05/02/indecent-proposal-set-apt-pupil/\">several</a><a href=\"https://variety.com/2014/film/news/bryan-singer-gary-goddard-hit-with-new-sex-abuse-lawsuit-1201171474/\"> lawsuits</a>, many of them <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/i-considered-suicide-alleged-sex-abuse-victim-of-bryan-singer-tells-the-daily-beast\">dismissed</a> for various reasons) and about his on-set behavior, with reports of <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bryan-singer-the-epitome-of-hollywoods-white-male-privilege-problem\">clashes with other actors</a> and persistent lateness. According to <em><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-fox-hired-fired-bryan-singer-bohemian-rhapsody-1156527\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>,</em> before Singer was approved by Fox to direct <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>, the studio head Stacey Snider warned him not to break the law and to show up to work every day—an extraordinary demand to make of a person in charge of a $55 million project. But according to Fox, Singer failed to comply, and the studio fired him before production was complete (Directors Guild rules mandate that Singer retain the director credit).</p><p data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/bryan-singers-accusers-speak-out/580462/?utm_source=feed\">Read: ‘Nobody is going to believe you’</a>]</i></p><p>Why would anyone be in line for a $10 million paycheck after such an experience? Lerner’s initial <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/reaction-bryan-singer-allegations-lesson-willful-ignorance/581302/?utm_source=feed\">defense</a> was that the movie Singer got fired from was still a commercial hit. “The over $800 million <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> has grossed, making it the highest-grossing drama in film history, is testament to his remarkable vision and acumen,” Lerner said in a statement. It’s worth noting that while Singer has directed many hits, he’s also overseen financial disappointments: 2013’s <em>Jack the Giant Slayer</em> was a notorious bomb, losing a reported <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jack-giant-slayer-could-lose-432584\">$140 million</a> for its studio, while his <em>Superman Returns </em><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/bryan-singer-why-superman-returns-179292\">performed worse than expected</a>, failing to produce a sequel and burdened by a staggering $200 million-plus budget.</p><p>Singer certainly doesn’t deserve sole credit for <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>’s success; the high grosses are at least partly thanks to the enduring popularity of the band Queen, one of the best-selling musical acts of all time. On the other hand, <em>Red Sonja</em>, a reboot of a Brigitte Nielsen–starring action drama that made<a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=redsonja.htm\"> $6.9 million in 1985</a>, is a much more marginal property. Lerner and Millennium Films had not even secured financing for the project yet, and the company was looking to attract investors this month at the <a href=\"https://www.efm-berlinale.de/en/home/homepage.html\">European Film Market</a>, an annual gathering of movie-business operatives attached to the Berlin Film Festival. At the best of times, a <em>Red Sonja </em>revival might not be the hottest title at EFM; with Singer’s name attached, arguably no sage investor would jump on board.</p><p>Hence the apparent step back. Singer hasn’t been officially removed from the movie, but without any funding, cast announcements, or immediate plans to begin filming, the project essentially doesn’t exist. Lerner, for his part, has only somewhat backtracked on his original statement in defense of Singer, telling <em>Deadline </em>that his comments “came out the wrong way,” and that “I think victims should be heard and this allegation should be taken very, very seriously … I just don’t agree to judge by Twitter. I want [the accused] to be judged by the court.”</p><p>Lerner has his own experience with high-profile misconduct allegations. The actor Terry Crews <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/06/terry-crews-senate-testimony-sexual-assault-expendables-4-threatened-trouble-1202417462/\">told a Senate panel</a> last year that Lerner had threatened to fire him from the fourth <em>Expendables </em>movie if Crews didn’t drop a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/06/terry-crews-and-the-discomfort-of-masculine-anxiety/564047/?utm_source=feed\">sexual-harassment case</a> against the Hollywood agent Adam Venit. (Lerner <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/avi-lerner-says-he-never-read-his-controversial-statement-defending-bryan-singer-1181063\">told</a> <em>The Hollywood Reporter that </em>he was simply asking for “some kind of peace.”) In 2017, Lerner <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2017/05/avi-lerner-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-millennium-films-nu-image-gender-bias-1202083560/\">was sued</a> by a former employee who alleged sexual harassment by the CEO and other top-level employees, gender discrimination, and the fostering of a hostile work environment. (Lerner called the suit “all lies” and “a joke.”) “Abusers protect abusers,” Crews told senators, recounting Lerner’s alleged intervention on behalf of Venit. But despite Lerner’s initial efforts to defend Singer, the shelving of <em>Red Sonja</em> suggests that the director’s reputation could finally be a meaningful roadblock for his career in Hollywood.</p><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/L1Z4yuV9OiI\" height=\"1\">",

A <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-begins-massive-layoffs-1832571288\"><em>Kotaku</em> report</a> elaborates that employees were cut across most of the company, noting that “layoffs have affected Activision, Blizzard, King, and some of Activision’s studios, including High Moon,” although Blizzard itself largely saw cuts only to “non-game-development departments.”</p>\n<p></p>",

But those two games remain the only titles with cross-console play, and some developers are calling out Sony for “playing favorites” with which games it is and isn’t allowing to have the feature, <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/sony-says-its-open-for-business-on-ps4-cross-play-but-1832570505\">via <em>Kotaku</em></a>.</p>\n<p>For its part, Sony’s Shawn Layden claimed in <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2019/02/11/shawn-layden-on-playstation-and-the-future\">an interview with <em>Game Informer</em> this week</a> that the company is “open for business” when it comes to cross-console multiplayer, adding that “All it takes is for publishers and developers who wish to permission it,” and that interested developers should work with their PlayStation account manager to get the ball rolling. </p>\n<div><aside><q>Outside of ‘Rocket League’ and<em> ‘</em>Fornite<em>,’</em> change doesn’t quite seem to be happening</q></aside></div>\n<p>But outside of <em>Rocket League</em> and<em> Fornite</em> (two of the largest and most visible games in the world) that change doesn’t quite seem to be happening. Following Layden’s remarks, the CEO of Chucklefish Games <a href=\"https://www.resetera.com/threads/shawn-layden-blames-publishers-and-developers-for-lack-of-playstation-crossplay-up-wargroove-dev-chucklefish-responds-in-thread-we-were-told-no.99096/\">took to ResetEra’s forums</a> to comment that his team had encountered issues with Sony for the recently released <em>Wargroove</em>, which already supports Xbox One, PC, and Switch cross-play. The team apparently “made many requests for crossplay (both through our account manager and directly with higher ups) all the way up until release month [but] were told in no uncertain terms that it was not going to happen.” According to Chucklefish, enabling cross-play would only require them to “*literally* toggle a switch and have it working.” </p>\n<p>Stew Chisam, the CEO of Hi-Rez studio, took to Twitter with similar complaints today, asking Sony to “stop playing favorites” and noting that his team has <em>Smite</em>, <em>Paladins</em>, and <em>Realm Royale</em> ready for cross-play for whenever Sony will allow them. (<em>Smite</em> just launched cross-play today for all platforms except for the PlayStation 4.)</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sony?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Sony</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayStation?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PlayStation</a>.

In <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/02/an-update-on-android-things.html\">a blog post</a> today, Google said that it’s refocusing Android Things — its Android-based platform for smart devices — exclusively on smart speakers and smart displays. That’s a much narrower scope than the all-encompassing Internet of Things platform that Google had initially dreamed up.</p>\n<p>When Android Things was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/13/13924996/android-things-announced-smart-home-iot-operating-system\">first announced</a> in December 2016, Google envisioned it as an operating system that would let developers code for a whole world of smart devices using the tools they already knew from coding for Android phones. At the time, that included speakers and displays, but also more experimental gadgets, like small robots, art installations, a projector, a 3D printer, and more.</p>\n<div><aside><q>Google’s initial vision was to connect everything with various IoT tools</q></aside></div>\n<p>But it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17320414/android-things-1-release-commercial-devices-google-io-2018\">took two years</a> for Android Things to actually ship, and it seems to have only arrived on a small number of speakers and displays.</p>\n<p>On top of that, Google has recently put a bigger emphasis on using Google Assistant rather than Android Things as the connective tissue for smart devices. In January, Google announced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18172195/google-assistant-connect-e-ink-screen-gadget-smarthome-ecosystem-ces-2019\">Google Assistant Connect</a>, a way to build Assistant into all kinds of devices, from simple e-paper displays to connected dishwashers. Google may not run the core of those devices, but its software still enables the same types of connectivity.</p>\n<p>Google’s original ambitions for a smart device platform were actually even bigger. Android Things was itself a reinvention of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8683147/google-brillo-weave-internet-of-things-solution\">a platform called Brillo</a>, announced in 2015, that was described as the “underlying operating system for the internet of things.” It was an “Android-derived” OS meant to simplify development of all kinds of smart gadgets and IoT integrations.</p>\n<p>“You can imagine a farmer managing the entire farm from a smartphone, the security cameras, the sensors, the irrigation equipment. All of them can be connected so that it works better together,” then-Android chief (and now-CEO) Sundar Pichai said back in 2015. Brillo and other Google-made tools were supposed to make that happen.</p>\n<p>So Google’s Android IoT ambitions seem to have gone from “everything” to “consumer smart devices” to just “speakers and smart displays.” </p>\n<p>That said, Android Things has delivered a growing wave of Google Assistant-enabled screens, like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17616560/lenovo-smart-display-review-google-assistant-smart-speaker-screen\">this one from Lenovo</a>, which are important in Google’s play for the smart home market. But it’s far smaller than what Google had initially envisioned.</p>",

Epic responded to Ferguson’s complaint with a long list of legal defenses — including the claim that its dance emote, known as “<a href=\"https://fortniteskins.net/emotes/swipe-it/\">Swipe It</a>,” isn’t even using the same moves.</p>\n<p>In its defense, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5735723-Epic-Games.html\">Epic’s lawyers wrote</a> that Ferguson’s dance — as seen in the music video below — was too simple to be protected by copyright. “No one can own a dance step,” the motion reads, because “individual dance steps and simple dance routines are not protected by copyright, but rather are building blocks of free expression.” It also argued that the context is vitally different: while Ferguson used “Milly Rock” moves “while listening and dancing to music with his friends, Swipe It’s role in <em>Fortnite</em> is to allow players to express themselves on the battlefield.”</p>\n<div><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PMzDoFuVgRg?rel=0\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p>Even beyond those claims, Epic claims the “Milly Rock” dance and Swipe It are only tangentially related. Its defense exhaustively describes the moves involved in each dance, based on video submitted for the lawsuit. (Sadly, there is not an accompanying diagram.) Here’s its description of 2 Milly’s move:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Dance Step consists of a side step to the right while swinging the left arm horizontally across the chest to the right, and then reversing the same movement on the other side — namely, a side step to the left while swinging the right arm horizontally across the chest to the left.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And here’s how it describes “Swipe It”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By contrast, Swipe It consists of (1) varying arm movements, sometimes using a straight, horizontal arc across the chest, and other times starting below the hips and then traveling in a diagonal arc across the body, up to the shoulder, while pivoting on the balls and heels of the feet, (2) a wind up of the right arm before swiping, and (3) a rolling motion of the hands and forearms between swipes.</p>\n<p>Moreover, whereas in the Dance Step, the torso, shoulders, and head face frontward while the ribs move from side to side with the arm movements; in Swipe It, the torso, shoulders, and head turn to the side with the arm movement, and the ribs remain in place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>2 Milly’s dance, it notes, is also performed at a “significantly quicker” tempo.</p>\n<p>These are actually important details, because Ferguson’s complaint claimed that Epic analyzes and copies dance moves frame by frame, resulting in emotes that were “identical in every respect” to the original. But the moves are still similar, and lots of people have made the connection between <em>Fortnite’s</em> emote and 2 Milly’s dance step.</p>\n<p>In a statement, 2 Milly’s lawyers claim that the dance in question is choreography and therefore protectable. “It is obvious that Epic took 2 Milly’s dance and sought to profit off of it,” David Hecht, of the law firm Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price &amp; Hecht, said. “Epic is essentially talking out of both sides of its mouth in its motion to dismiss: it argues that, one the one hand, the ‘Swipe-It’ emote is not the Milly Rock (which is ridiculous, as fans have long recognized the emote is a copy of Milly’s signature dance) but it also argues that, on the other hand, even if it is Milly’s dance, it is not protectable. Regarding latter point, the law is clear that dance choreography is protectable under the Copyright Act.” </p>\n<p>The more interesting issue is still when (and whether) you can legally own a short dance like the one in “Milly Rock.” Dance can only be copyrighted if it reaches the level of “choreography,” and there’s not much established case law around video game gestures. Ferguson’s lawsuit is one of a few complaints against Epic over <em>Fortnite</em> emotes — each situation slightly different, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/20/18149869/fortnite-dance-emote-lawsuit-milly-rock-floss-carlton\">all of them uphill battles</a> for the dancers involved.</p>\n<p>There are good reasons to avoid granting strict legal protections to short dance sequences — copyright can stifle new, creative adaptations of old works. But <a href=\"https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bkgj/fortnite-fortnight-black-appropriation-dance-emote\">as <em>Waypoint</em> recently argued</a>, copying artists like Ferguson (especially without credit) could still be unethical, even if it turns out to be legal.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update 2/12, 7:32PM ET: </strong></em><em>Added statement from the law firm representing 2 Milly in this case. </em></p>",

Images previewing the service <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197833/apple-news-subscription-service-ios-12-2-beta\">were found in an iOS 12.2 beta last month</a>, indicating that Apple may be close to launch. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/publishers-chafe-at-apples-terms-for-subscription-news-service-11549998416\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported earlier today</a> that Apple was having some issues with publisher partners over revenue splits for the upcoming service, with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18222281/apple-news-subscription-service-50-percent-cut-publishers-media-deal\">Apple reportedly demanding a staggering 50 percent cut</a> before dividing the other half between publishers based on how much their articles were read. The service is rumored to cost $10 per month, although that number hasn’t been finalized, according to the <em>WSJ</em>. </p>\n<p>The paid Apple News subscription — along with Apple Music and the upcoming TV service — is part of Apple’s renewed focus on selling paid services going forward, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18201562/apple-earnings-iphone-sales-revenue-fall-drop-holiday-quarter-q1-2019\">following a slump in iPhone sales</a> that has led the company to explore new sources of revenue for the future. </p>",

Hollywood and the US Government have signaled this in the past, and with a booming local movie industry, China is now committed to taking action as well. </p>\n<p>Last week was the Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, which is generally a busy time at the box office. However, it’s also high time for pirates, which spurred the National Copyright Administration  (<a href=\"http://en.ncac.gov.cn/\">NCAC</a>) into action.</p>\n<p><span>“In</span> recent days, after the joint action of multiple departments and rightsholders, the piracy of Spring Festival movies has been curbed. We will refer the serious infringements and piracy cases to the public security department to take criminal measures,” NCAC announced on the local social media site <a href=\"https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4338203609430775\">Weibo</a></p>\n<p>The Copyright Administration called on the public to help and report instances of piracy through direct messages on Weibo, WeChat, and email. </p>\n<p>“Please provide infringement clues and clean up the online copyright environment. Let’s work together,” the Government outfit wrote.</p>\n<p>Piracy is a growing concern among Chinese filmmakers, especially now that the local movie industry is booming. One of the widely pirated movies is the sci-fi blockbuster “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7605074/\">The Wandering Earth.</a>” The film premiered during the Spring Festival and broke records by grossing over 2 billion yuan (US$300 million).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://torrentfreak.com/images/wanteringearth.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-168239\"><figcaption>Photo: YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8LAwozrXPo\">trailer</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>The makers are obviously happy with this achievement. Over the past few days, however, they were preoccupied with taking down links to pirated copies. Gong Ge’er, who heads the movie’s anti-piracy unit, says that they complained to the Government as well, the South China Morning Post <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2185703/chinese-sci-fi-blockbuster-wandering-earth-battles-horde\">reports</a>.</p>\n<p>“In recent days, the staff of <em>The Wandering Earth</em> have not had time to celebrate the box office success, but have devoted almost all their energy to complaining to authorities about piracy and blocking pirated copies,” Gong told the Beijing Youth Daily.</p>\n<p>Compared to last year there was a significant drop in moviegoers during the Spring Festival. This is partly due to online. In addition, leaked copies of The Wandering Earth and other blockbusters were also sold online, starting at one yuan per copy.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" srcset=\"https://torrentfreak.com/images/wandersell.png 460w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/wandersell-200x150.png 200w\" src=\"https://torrentfreak.com/images/wandersell.png\" class=\"wp-image-168243\"><figcaption>For sale</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>While piracy is certainly not a new phenomenon in China, it’s interesting to see that the authorities are calling on the public to help. And according to a recent update from the Copyright Administration, this has paid off.</p>\n<p>“All the infringement and piracy reports received through Weibo, WeChat, email, and other channels will be sorted out and handed over to the relevant copyright law enforcement agencies. We hope that the majority of users continue to provide relevant clues,” NCAC wrote.</p>\n<p>This will sound like music to the ears of the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA), a trade group that also represents Hollywood’s interest. Just last week it informed the U.S. Government that China must step up its game to better protect the interests of copyright holders, listing some examples of problematic sites. </p>\n<p>“Traditional website piracy remains a major issue in China, causing significant damage to rights holders. Notorious piracy sites that disrupt the music and audiovisual marketplaces include zimuzu.tv, dytt8.net, 666c.com, sacdr.net, yymp3.com, musicool.cn, dy2018.com, xh127.com, b9good.com, dygang.com, loldytt.com, piaohua.com, bttt99.com, 80s.tw, meijutt.com, ygdy8.com, dysfz.vip, panduoduo.net, btbtdy.net, and lbldy.com,” IIPA wrote.</p>\n<p>Perhaps IIPA can address their concerns to the Chinese authorities directly as well, via Weibo, WeChat, or email.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/\">TF</a>, for the latest info on copyright, file-sharing, <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-popular-torrent-sites-of-2018-180107/\">torrent sites</a> and more.

The paid Apple News service is said to work a lot like Netflix or Hulu does for TV shows — users would pay a single monthly price to Apple and get access to a wide range of paid news sources and magazines all bundled together. </p>\n<p>But Apple is apparently running into issues with publishers over how much of that money (rumored to be $10 per month per subscriber) will make its way back to the creators of the content. According to the <em>WSJ</em>, Apple is currently proposing deals in which it would keep half that revenue for itself, while the other half would be divvied up based on how much time users spend reading each publisher’s content. The model is similar in ways to how Spotify has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/7/9861372/spotify-year-in-review-artist-payment-royalties\">calculated artist payouts in the past</a> based on overall listening times. </p>\n<div><aside><q>Publishers are also concerned that they wouldn’t get access to subscriber data</q></aside></div>\n<p>Notably, the <em>WSJ</em> claims the proposed price split means major news sites like <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>Washington Post</em> have yet to agree to license content for the service. (For its part, the <em>WSJ</em> also says its own talks with Apple are going well.) Publishers are also concerned they wouldn’t get access to subscriber data with Apple’s news service, depriving companies of the email and credit card information that’s key to marketing efforts, leading to another point of contention. </p>\n<p>We’ve been down this road before, too — Apple trying to extract unreasonably unfair terms from content creators is what has doomed its TV ambitions for years, to the point where Apple simply is now spending millions in creating its own exclusive content for its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18202831/apple-tv-streaming-tim-cook-earnings-call-investors-disney-netlflix-hulu\">upcoming TV service</a> instead of licensing from other sources. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eel0TmYvwrcIqkT3sSu-sAcbRRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13714874/Apple_News_subscription1__1_.png\">\n<cite><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/25/images-show-apple-preparing-news-app-in-ios-12-2-for-new-magazine-subscription-service/\" target=\"_blank\">9to5Mac</a></cite>\n</figure>\n<p>Adding to the pressure is that Apple’s paid news service is coming at a critical time for the company, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18201562/apple-earnings-iphone-sales-revenue-fall-drop-holiday-quarter-q1-2019\">one that has seen iPhone sales slump</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18174572/apple-tim-cook-announce-new-services-this-year-tv\">a new emphasis on services</a> as a key revenue source for the company. Apple News comes preinstalled on every one of the billions of iOS devices in the world, and converting even a fraction of those users into ongoing paid subscribers would be a huge addition to Apple’s services business. </p>\n<p>It’s a strategy the company has already used to achieve great success with Apple Music, which leveraged its first-party positioning <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8487726/apple-music-56-million-users-report\">to offer actual competition to Spotify</a>. Pulling a similar coup with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18022980/apple-news-90-million-readers-subscription-service-rumor\">News and its 90 million users</a> would be key to the company’s future — but it needs to have compelling content, from partners who feel the deal is worth it, in order to accomplish that. Asking <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/02/vice-layoffs-buzzfeed-huffpost-media.html\">already beleaguered news publishers</a> to fight over just half the total revenue on a per-view basis seems like a bad way to start. </p>\n<p>Apple is still said to be negotiating exact details with publishers and finalizing its plans for the service, which is rumored to launch sometime later this year. So it’s possible this could all change. But as a starting point of negotiation, it seems like Apple may be asking for too much. </p>",

There’s still no direct way to upload photos, and the service is slow to add new features. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17904788/instagram-browser-notifications-chrome-safari-firefox-lite\">Browser notification support</a> was added only last September. Some features, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16665934/instagram-stories-web-uploading-launches\">ability to upload stories</a>, are restricted to the mobile app and mobile web only. Instagram has said it has “no plans to let users upload photos or stories from the desktop.” Direct messages coming to the web would be a huge step forward for the previously mobile-only app. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Instagram's Direct on Web will also be available on desktop <a href=\"https://t.co/Y3iTIdDwKV\">pic.twitter.com/Y3iTIdDwKV</a></p>— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1095407604447080449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 12, 2019</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>There are multiple reasons why this shift to the web could be happening now. Instagram has built a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16740280/instagram-direct-messaging-app-test-standalone\">standalone messaging app called Direct</a>, which it began testing in six countries in 2017, and the move to the desktop could be a sign that messaging has taken on increased importance to the Instagram team. The move could also have something to do with Facebook’s plans to consolidate Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram DMs into <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/23/17157618/instagram-desktop-browser-mobile-app\">a single, unified platform</a>. For now, an Instagram spokesperson told <em>The Verge</em> that the feature isn’t being publicly tested.</p>",

            "content": "<div><div><div><p>A recent public statement from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission implied that those engaged in writing and publishing code might need to worry about running afoul of securities laws. In its <span><a rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/digital-asset-securites-issuuance-and-trading\">statement</a></span> about the <span><a rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2018/34-84553.pdf\">cease and desist order</a></span> against the co-founder of decentralized cryptocurrency exchange EtherDelta, the SEC indicated that someone who simply “provides an algorithm” might be found to be running a securities exchange.  In the order itself, the SEC stated that EtherDelta’s creator had violated securities laws because he “wrote and deployed” code that he “should have known” would contribute to EtherDelta’s alleged violations. EFF today sent a public letter reminding the agency that writing and publishing code is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment, and that the courts don’t take kindly to government agencies requiring people to obtain licenses before exercising their free speech rights. </p>\n<p>EtherDelta was founded by Zachary Coburn. The SEC charged Coburn with running an unregistered national securities exchange, and he settled and agreed to pay over $300,000. While EFF takes no position on whether other aspects of EtherDelta violated the law or SEC regulations, EFF urged the SEC to clarify its dangerously broad language regarding potential liability for merely writing and publishing code.</p>\n<p>Setting aside whatever other issues the SEC might have had with EtherDelta, there are many reasons why software that enables decentralized currency or other exchanges may be useful to consumers. That’s why it’s important that regulatory interventions today don’t stifle that innovation by claiming they can impose liability merely for the act of writing or distributing code. </p>\n<p> Centralized exchanges invest power in a central intermediary, which can freeze the funds of customers, block certain customers from the platform, or <span><a rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/1905680-Does-Coinbase-freeze-accounts\">block specific transactions</a></span>, with no obligations to provide affected customers with an appeals process.

These centralized exchanges are also a target for criminals seeking to <span><a rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17151430/bankruptcy-mt-gox-liabilities-bitcoin\">steal customer funds</a></span>, and can themselves be run by unscrupulous individuals who abuse their access to customer funds and data.</p>\n<p>For these and other reasons, EFF has called on cryptocurrency exchanges to <span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/07/five-policy-issues-blockchain-startups-care-about-user-rights-should-think-about\">adopt best practices around defending user rights</a></span>, including issuing regular transparency reports. It’s also not surprising that regulators are cracking down on exchanges, and indeed EFF supports regulators stepping in to hold exchanges accountable for engaging in fraud, theft, and other misleading business practices.</p>\n<p>But there’s also a technological response to the risks of centralized exchanges, and that’s where decentralized exchanges come in.</p>\n<p>Decentralized exchanges allow for the exchange of digital currencies using smart contracts. Requests to sell and buy cryptocurrency can be submitted to a smart contract that matches and completes these transactions. Decentralized exchanges often don’t need to hold funds for customers—rather, customers can maintain possession of their cryptocurrency, and the decentralized exchange can automatically complete exchanges  without taking possession of the assets. Decentralized exchanges thus do not need to hold a honeypot of money that might attract criminals, as centralized exchanges do, and cannot themselves steal funds. Furthermore, because trades are not approved by an individual or company, they cannot easily be censored by an intermediary.</p>\n<p>Decentralized exchanges are in their earliest stages of development. They aren’t widely used right now, but this is an area of rapid research and innovation.  Many cryptographers and programmers are experimenting with smart contract systems to develop new systems to help users correct the power imbalances they face when engaging in online transactions. </p>\n<p>When describing its action against EtherDelta, the SEC argued that EtherDelta “provided a marketplace for bringing together buyers and sellers for digital asset securities through the combined use of an order book—a website that displayed orders—and a smart contract run on the Ethereum blockchain.” The SEC said it would take a “functional approach” to determining whether something was or was not an exchange that should register with the SEC: “The activity that actually occurs between the buyers and sellers—and not the kind of technology or the terminology used by the entity operating or promoting the system—determines whether the system operates as a marketplace and meets the criteria of an exchange under Rule 3b-16(a).”</p>\n<p>The SEC wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A system uses established non-discretionary methods if it provides a trading facility or sets rules.  For example, an entity that provides an algorithm, run on a computer program or on a smart contract using blockchain technology, as a means to bring together or execute orders could be providing a trading facility. As another example, an entity that sets execution priorities, standardizes material terms for digital asset securities traded on the system, or requires orders to conform with predetermined protocols of a smart contract, could be setting rules. Additionally, if one entity arranges for other entities, either directly or indirectly, to provide the various functions of a trading system that together meet the definition of an exchange, the entity arranging the collective efforts could be considered to have established an exchange.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> The SEC’s broad language about “an entity that provides an algorithm” could include cryptographic researchers and coders who are publishing ideas or code for debate and discussion, and working to develop systems that could benefit the public. Even if the individuals never deployed the code and never actively maintained or promoted a decentralized exchange, this overly broad language implies the SEC could well expect people merely writing and publishing code to register as a national securities exchange or face liability.</p>\n<p><span>The free speech protections enshrined in the First Amendment and upheld through court cases across decades include the rights of individuals to publish their ideas without preemptively obtaining a license.</span></p>\n<p> This isn’t just dangerous because it could quell research; it’s unconstitutional. The free speech protections enshrined in the First Amendment and upheld through court cases across decades include the rights of individuals to publish their ideas without preemptively obtaining a license. And code itself is speech. EFF fought to establish this principle in 1995, which led a federal court to <span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2008/04/21-34\">strike down</a></span> Commerce Department export restrictions on encryption technologies for exactly this reason, ruling that forcing cryptographic researchers to obtain a license before publishing their work was a gross violation of the freedom of expression. Other courts have recognized this principle, and today it is not controversial that writing code implicates the same First Amendment protections as writing in any other language.</p>\n<p>Imposing liability on coders and researchers who fail to obtain a license as a national security exchange prior to publishing their code on GitHub or describing their methods in a white paper would similarly be an affront to the First Amendment. This would unfairly hamper the expressive rights of countless coders and researchers in this space. As we explained to the SEC, restricting the ability to merely write and publish code would fail the well-established test for imposing restraints on speech. Courts have found that such restraints are justified only in unusual and extreme circumstances, and they must survive the most exacting scrutiny.</p>\n<p>There were many facts in the specific case of EtherDelta that may have attracted the SEC’s attention, but the act of publishing code used in a decentralized exchange should not be one of them. As we said in our letter to the SEC, it is crucial that those engaged in developing protocols, verifying transactions through mining, and writing code are not held liable for operating, or assisting with operating, a securities exchange. Imposing regulatory or criminal liability for such activity would run afoul of the First Amendment. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/2019/02/12/correspondence_from_eff_re_in_the_matter_of_zachary_coburn_file_no._3-18888-2.pdf\">Read our letter.</a></p>\n<p>Note: EFF is grateful to <span><a rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://twitter.com/josephbonneau\">Prof. Joseph Bonneau</a></span>, <span><a rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://twitter.com/LindsayxLin\">Lindsay Lin</a></span>, and <span><a rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://twitter.com/MartaBelcher\">Marta Belcher</a></span> for providing feedback related to blockchain technology and policy.</p>\n</div></div></div>",

But that rollout is still happening, and today the carrier announced the next two cities: Chicago and Minneapolis, both of which should get AT&amp;T’s real 5G network sometime later in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/12/att-5g-chicago-minneapolis/\">via <em>Engadget</em></a>. </p>\n<p>The news is about par for the course for AT&amp;T’s 5G ambitions so far: the company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18146246/att-5g-us-launch-hotspot-service-plan-price\">technically launched its network</a> in twelve cities late last year (Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Louisville, Oklahoma City, New Orleans, Raleigh, San Antonio, and Waco), but there’s still no actual hardware that regular customers can go out and buy and use with the next-gen network. AT&amp;T is promising phones for later this year — including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18126980/att-samsung-5g-phone-mmwave-sub-6ghz-smartphone-network\">two 5G devices</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/4/18125423/att-5g-samsung-phone-spring-2019-galaxy-s10\">from Samsung</a> that could be announced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/10/18176584/samsung-foldable-event-galaxy-s10-date-time-announcement\">as early as next week</a> — but for now, it’s still largely a theoretical network. </p>\n<p>Chicago and Minneapolis join Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Nashville, Orlando, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose on the list of cities that AT&amp;T has announced plans to add service to in 2019. So even if the actual offerings are a little slim right now, it’s clear that AT&amp;T has ambition when it comes to 5G. Soon, we’ll get to see if it can actually start to deliver. </p>\n<p></p>",

Not anymore.</p>\n<p>Technically, the rule is currently just in preview at the <em>Federal Register</em>, won’t be published until tomorrow, and citizens will have a 30-day comment period to respond. But the FAA argues the need is urgent enough that it’s firing off the rule just 10 days after publication.</p>\n<div><aside><q>The FAA might let you fly at night and over people, but not right away</q></aside></div>\n<p>That’s not the only drone-related news in preview at the <em>Federal Register</em> today, by the way. Though the FAA is still poised to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18183830/faa-drone-regulations-usa-crowds-night\">majorly relax its rules about flying your drone at night and over crowds of people</a>, the agency now says it won’t be doing that until it can figure out a system to let it remotely track and identify drones at a distance, something the industry is also working on itself (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/14/16634572/dji-aeroscope-drone-detection-interception-tech-next-level-lauren-goode\">here’s what we learned about DJI’s Aeroscope</a>), and it’s <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-00758.pdf\">asking the public to comment</a> on what sorts of performance and legal restrictions it should place on drones before they’re allowed to do those things.</p>\n<p>For nighttime, where the FAA says it’s never had a reported accident, the agency is considering that operators might merely need to complete some extra training and have a drone with a light that’s visible three miles away. But for flying over crowds, the FAA thinks it might create three new categories of drones, with ones weighing 0.55 pounds or less being freely able to fly over people, while heavier drones might need to have speed, altitude, location, and injury “severity threshold” requirements so they’re safe enough to use.</p>\n<aside><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data=\"{&quot;stories&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Drones are already being confiscated near the Super Bowl&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207081/super-bowl-2019-drones-atlanta-fbi&quot;},{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;London’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports have purchased their own anti-drone systems &quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/5/18169215/london-heathrow-gatwick-airports-anti-drone-defense-systems&quot;},{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;DJI’s Mavic 2 Pro and Zoom take drone photography to new heights&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17826384/dji-mavic-2-pro-zoom-drone-review-specs-price&quot;}]}\"></div></aside><p></p>\n<p></p>",

            "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarah Krebs is used to corpses going missing. As a detective who works in the missing-persons unit in Detroit, she has solved dozens of cases by matching up disappeared people to unidentified bodies left in state custody. But for older cases in which the county was supposed to have buried the body, Krebs says it’s common for her to order an exhumation from the local cemetery and discover that the body she’s looking for is not there.</p><p>Anywhere from a few days to a few years later, those bones might turn up in a separate burial plot, or in a box on a medical examiner’s shelf, or in a law-enforcement evidence room, or in a county employee’s house. “I have multiple, multiple cases where we thought the body was buried and we found a couple days later that someone had it at home,” Krebs says.</p><p>The reason for this morbid confusion is that the United States is enduring a cadaver pileup. Medical examiners around the country are being overrun with bodies that no one comes to pick up, a trend that many coroners attribute to the nation’s opioid epidemic. Drug-overdose deaths <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/11/us-life-expectancy-keeps-falling/576664/?utm_source=feed\">increased</a> by 10 percent from 2016 to 2017, largely driven by fentanyls and similar drugs, according to the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. Now medical examiners in cities such as Detroit process dozens of new remains each day. And as Krebs has encountered, some of those bodies can slip under the radar.</p><p data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/05/john-doe-jane-doe/482961/?utm_source=feed\">Read: What happens to a dead body no one can name?</a>]</i></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The bodies that remain accounted for, meanwhile, float in and out of state custody. No one is quite sure what to do with them. The United States has no uniform system for managing the unclaimed. There is no federal law outlining what steps to take, and many states do not have clear procedures, leaving individual medical examiners to make decisions about how to best deal with the bodies. As a result, examiners without money to simply bury or cremate the remains are resorting to inventive—and strange—solutions.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Among the unclaimed bodies processed in the United States, some are the unidentified remains from missing-persons cases like the ones Krebs works on, but the majority belong to people who were estranged from their family while they were alive, according to Kenna Quinet, an associate professor at Indiana University—Purdue University Indianapolis who <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1556-4029.12973\">co-wrote</a> one of the only academic articles on unclaimed bodies. In most of these cases, the identity of the victim is known, but coroners or funeral directors can’t contact the next of kin, or the next of kin was reached and either doesn’t want the body or can’t afford to bury it. The unclaimed population skews poor and homeless.</p><p>Policy makers have rarely backed programs that would set clear terms for the management of the unclaimed, which has left coroners to cycle through a grab bag of disposition methods once a body enters their custody. Coroners often opt to cremate unclaimed remains to save money—burials cost at least twice as much—but some states don’t allow coroners to request a cremation for fear that it could infringe on the deceased’s religious values. In smaller counties that have fewer unclaimed bodies, bodies are kept in coolers; those that are cremated are <a href=\"http://www.live5news.com/story/37519991/live-5-investigates-unclaimed-human-remains-stack-up-in-some-lowcountry-counties/\">left in boxes</a> or in a coroner’s <a href=\"https://www.statesboroherald.com/local/determining-fate-unclaimed-cremains/\">closet</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Los Angeles County has one of the more organized systems. There, unclaimed bodies are cremated if no one comes to retrieve them within a month of death, after which the cremains are kept in the county coroner’s office for another three years, according to the <em><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-unclaimed-dead-20181205-story.html\">Los Angeles Times</a></em>. If by that point no family has reached out, the cremains are buried alongside more than a thousand others in an <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-unclaimed-dead-20181205-story.html\">annual interfaith funeral</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But because of a lack of funding, counties cannot always afford to pay funeral directors to cremate or bury unclaimed bodies. Only 14 states devote money to funeral costs for unclaimed bodies, and it <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/special/2009/06/disposition_of_unclaimed_bodie.html\">rarely covers</a> the actual volume of bodies that coroners and funeral directors face. West Virginia, which has the highest rate of opioid deaths in the United States, has run out of funds two years in a row, the state’s Funeral Directors Association told me. And while some counties and towns provide funds in addition to the state’s contribution, many don’t.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That has left cash-poor cities like Detroit to scatter remains in haphazard ways. Shortly after the financial crisis, according to Krebs, the county medical examiner stashed unclaimed bodies in a refrigerated semitrailer in a back parking lot, a last resort usually reserved for disasters like <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-28/backlogged-corpses-are-grim-testament-to-puerto-rico-s-challenge\">Hurricane Maria</a>. Two funeral homes the City contracted with are currently under investigation after some bodies were found <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/investigations/2019/01/31/michigan-burial-assistance/2389123002/\">unburied</a>. When unclaimed bodies are in fact buried, Krebs says, the process is cheap and unglamorous: In some cases, cemetery workers have “dug a trench and lined up body bags.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Other cities have similarly drawn ire over their burial of the unclaimed. In 2015, Washington, D.C., <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/washingtons-unclaimed-remains-in-unmarked-graves-next-to-trash-cans/2015/07/19/a8c03ce2-24df-11e5-aae2-6c4f59b050aa_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.ba5d1f59db75\">discovered</a> that, in some cases, the funeral home that the City paid to bury its unclaimed bodies had simply dumped the remains in unmarked graves beside trash cans. (The funeral home claimed that it followed the terms of its contract.)</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Placing even more strain on medical examiners is the fact that a centuries-old method for clearing out unclaimed bodies—donating them to medical schools—is often no longer viable. Many states have long relied on donations, a tradition that surfaced in the 19th century following a series of riots against the then-common practice of robbing graves to supply bodies for anatomy research. The resulting Anatomy Acts, which passed in many U.S. states in 1831 and 1832, allowed medical schools to dissect “unclaimed bodies.” But as the historian Michael Sappol <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=JmadPEPJkRsC&q=%22starting+with+massachusetts%22#v=snippet&q=%22starting%20with%20massachusetts%22&f=false\">has written</a>, many of these bodies were simply people who couldn’t afford burials. New York <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/nyregion/law-bans-the-use-of-unclaimed-dead-as-cadavers-without-consent.html\">banned</a> unclaimed-body donations in 2016 after an outcry, and even in states where handing over unclaimed bodies is legal, many medical schools <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586224\">now refuse</a> to take them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">All this means that solutions for managing the dead are getting weirder and more controversial—though not necessarily worse. While <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/us/11burial.html\">Tennessee</a> gives some unclaimed cadavers to “body farms” where researchers study decomposition, New York has <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/burying-nycs-forgotten-dead-at-hart-island/\">buried more than 1 million unclaimed bodies</a> on its inaccessible Hart Island, a 100-acre strip of land north of Manhattan. States such as North Carolina cremate unclaimed remains and <a href=\"https://www.wral.com/when-remains-unclaimed-nc-s-dead-scattered-at-sea/13876971/\">scatter them at sea</a>. Dallas, which is also overrun with unclaimed bodies, <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/dallas-county/2018/11/21/liquid-cremation-ruled-dallas-county-seeks-new-home-unclaimed-bodies\">briefly debated</a> liquefying remains through an environmentally friendly process known as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/10/how-to-be-eco-friendly-when-youre-dead/382120/?utm_source=feed\">alkaline hydrolysis</a>. That initiative failed after lawmakers expressed revulsion for the technique, which reduces human bodies to a brownish liquid and a set of bones.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/10/how-to-be-eco-friendly-when-youre-dead/382120/?utm_source=feed\">Read: How to be eco-friendly when you’re dead</a>]</i></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the meantime, some people are attempting to limit the number of bodies that go unclaimed in the first place. NamUs, a federal missing-persons database that has recently expanded to include unclaimed bodies, for instance, is attempting to make it easier for medical examiners to match unclaimed remains to missing persons. According to NamUs’s communication and case-management director, J. Todd Matthews, unclaimed bodies are often reported missing in a state other than where they actually died, but medical examiners don’t have direct access to the National Crime Information Center’s missing-person database. NamUs hopes its own database can provide an alternative search tool when medical examiners wind up with bodies whose family they can’t locate.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Still, many medical examiners don’t know NamUs exists, according to Matthews. Until any sort of procedure is standardized, unclaimed bodies in cities that see a high number of dead will continue to float from office to office, home to home, refrigerated truck to refrigerated truck. When Krebs needs to test the DNA of an unclaimed body for a missing-persons case, she will have to keep racing from building to building in search of the transient dead. And she won’t be surprised to find the bones she has been looking for in a glass display at a local university. She’s solved cold cases that way.</p><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/7opkztynWUE\" height=\"1\">",

Cheese’s serves reused leftover pizza to customers. Now, following the success of Dawson’s documentary, a Chuck E. Cheese’s spokesperson told <em>The Verge </em>that<em> </em>claims made by Dawson are untrue. </p>\n<p>“The claims made in this video about Chuck E. Cheese’s and our pizza are unequivocally false,” the spokesperson said. “No conspiracies here — our pizzas are made to order and we prepare our dough fresh in restaurant, which means that they’re not always perfectly uniform in shape, but always delicious.” </p>\n<p>Dawson’s theory, which has <a href=\"https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090719210400AAKXydJ&guccounter=1\">popped up online before</a>, suggests that because of the oblong slices and slice lines that don’t add up, the pizza is comprised of different pizzas. Examples can be seen below. Dawson alleges that Chuck E. Cheese’s employees bring unused pizza back into the kitchen, combine it with other pies, and use extra cheese as a way to blend it all together. He adds at one point in the video that a friend from high school who worked at Chuck E. Cheese’s once admitted they reused pizza slices, but acknowledges she might have lied.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOULwN4TzMQzz-Z58Kntx_74PM0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13754614/pizza_chuck.jpeg\">\n<cite>Shane Dawson/YouTube</cite>\n<figcaption>Pizza ordered by Dawson in the video. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The Chuck E. Cheese’s portion of Dawson’s video takes up approximately 30 minutes of the 1.5-hour video. It ends with Dawson bringing a pizza home and trying to recreate it, only to determine there must be missing pieces. Although Dawson’s video goes over three different stories, other YouTube creators have uploaded their own videos that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvKfzErkMEw\">focus on just the Chuck E. Cheese’s portion</a>.</p>\n<p>Dawson’s video, which amassed more than 7 million views in less than 24 hours, led other popular creators and viewers to address Chuck E. Cheese’s on Twitter, demanding answers. Other people tweeted jokes about the situation. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Chuck E Cheese be like<br><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>Enjoy :)</p>— zacques (@IsNotACop) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IsNotACop/status/1095139799873306624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 12, 2019</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/shanedawson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@shanedawson</a> made me hate the fact that I ever stepped foot in a Chuck E Cheese as a kid.

Following Dawson’s first entry in the series, a YouTube <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213648/shane-dawson-conspiracy-video-youtube-demoneitzation-community-guidelines\">spokesperson told <em>The Verge </em>last week</a> that “as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the user experience across our site, we’ll begin reducing recommendations of borderline content or videos that could misinform users in harmful ways.” A previous explanation of possible harmful <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197301/youtube-algorithm-conspiracy-theories-misinformation\">conspiracy theories given to <em>The Verge </em>last month</a> included flat-Earth documentaries, anti-vaccination videos, or 9/11 conspiracy theories. </p>\n<p>Essentially, YouTube is trying to figure out how to determine the difference between series like Dawson’s, which isn’t presenting an idea as fact, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/6/17656708/youtube-alex-jones-infowars-account-deleted-facebook-apple-spotify\">shows like Infowars</a>, which promoted the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/7/13870990/pizzagate-robertas-brooklyn-conspiracy-theory\">PizzaGate conspiracy theory as actual truth</a>. </p>\n<p>Still, Dawson’s video could be seen as potentially libelous against Chuck E. Cheese’s, suggesting Dawson’s video could be harmful to the business and deterring viewers who may have planned to visit. <em>The Verge </em>has reached out to YouTube for further comment.</p>",

We’ve seen the phone bundled with the likes of the Gear S3 smartwatch, the Amazon Echo Show, and the IconX earbuds, but today’s offer seems like the best yet. The 512GB model is <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2DuQIWA\" target=\"_blank\">discounted to $1,049</a> (its lowest price yet), and it comes with a Galaxy Tab A midrange tablet for free with purchase. The 128GB configuration qualifies for the bundle, too, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2I6cjdv\" target=\"_blank\">but at $999</a>, it’s hard to recommend since $50 more for the 512GB model quadruples your storage.</p>\n<div><div><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:2277700\"></div></div></div>\n<p>The original Sony PlayStation has its fans, and if you’re one of them, <a href=\"http://linksynergy.walmart.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=2149&u1=gooddeals&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-Classic-Console-Gray-3003868%2F659739661\">the PlayStation Classic is $39.99 at Walmart right now</a>. It debuted in November 2018, and has since been easy to find for around $59.99. Unfortunately, it’s not quite the love letter that the influential 32-bit console deserved. The game selection, and perhaps more importantly, the emulation of some of those 20 games included, isn’t up to snuff. Still, if you’re willing to look past its issues, this is the best deal we’ve seen yet.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RuV5hom1y3-qtP-eYYKgdVShjdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13754383/LS1__13_.jpg\">\n<cite>Nodus</cite>\n<figcaption><em>The Nodus Access Case III on the iPhone XS Max</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Until Valentine’s Day (February 14th, lest you need to be reminded!)

The coalition argued that losing Dreamer protections would cost the US economy $350 billion in GDP and $90 billion in tax revenue. </p>\n<p>“These are our friends, neighbors, and coworkers,” the letter reads, “and they should not have to wait for court cases to be decided to determine their fate when Congress can act now.”</p>\n<div><aside><q>“These are our friends, neighbors, and coworkers...”</q></aside></div>\n<p>The letter drew support from nearly every major figure in the tech and telecom world, including AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson and Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg, along with Apple’s Tim Cook, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google’s Sundar Pichai, and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. </p>\n<p>But two major companies were missing: T-Mobile and Sprint.</p>\n<p>T-Mobile and Sprint did not respond to requests for comment, but their absence from the letter may have something to do with the proposed merger between the two companies, announced in April and currently under review by the Department of Justice and FCC. The $26 billion deal would shrink the nation’s pool of major wireless carriers to just three, provided neither agency blocks it as anti-competitive. Both T-Mobile CEO John Legere and Sprint’s executive chairman Marcelo Claure have been actively lobbying with Trump administration officials for approval of the merger.</p>\n<p>In theory, signing onto a letter of support shouldn’t influence those decisions, but it would fly in the face of many of the president’s most vocally held policies. President Trump has been an outspoken opponent of the Obama administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) which allows for children who arrived in the US illegally to go to school and work in the country without becoming citizens or fearing deportation.</p>\n<p>In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/donald-trump-and-t-mobiles-legere-in-delightful-twitter-fight/\">Legere got into a spat with Trump on Twitter</a>, saying that he wasn’t happy with the service at the Trump Hotel in New York City. Trump lashed back, calling T-Mobile’s service “terrible.” Legere responded saying, “I will obviously leave your hotel right away based on this. #checkingout.” Any tweets disparaging Trump have now been deleted from Legere’s Twitter account.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NFnM5RGtED1i3kGtT5VDCFoN5T8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13754197/Screen_Shot_2019_02_12_at_12.03.31_PM.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>Just last week, the two telecommunications companies ramped up their efforts by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18116688/t-mobile-sprint-merger-deal-carriers-congress-house-pallone-nadler\">hiring former FCC Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn</a> to help nudge the deal forward. Legere also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/5/18212031/t-mobile-sprint-merger-lobbying-raise-rates-promise-fcc\">penned a letter to current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai</a>, promising not to increase consumer wireless plan prices for three years after the merger is finished.</p>\n<p>The merger is already facing significant opposition in Congress. On Tuesday, eight top Democrats signed onto letters asking FCC and Justice Department officials to spike the deal. Senators <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18222033/t-mobile-sprint-merger-block-democrats-fcc-doj-congress\">from Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) to Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)</a> argued the proposed merger would drive up wireless prices and have little effect on 5G deployment. </p>\n<p>Legere and other T-Mobile executives have also appealed to Trump’s personal financial interests, booking at least 52 nights at Trump’s DC hotel at $2,246 per night, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/t-mobile-executives-seeking-merger-approval-booked-more-than-52-nights-at-trumps-hotel--more-than-previously-known/2019/02/06/cd6fa7e6-29ca-11e9-b011-d8500644dc98_story.html?utm_term=.6d35669a4782\">according to <em>The Washington Post</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Legere and Claure are expected <a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-protecting-consumers-and-competition-an-examination-of-the-t\">to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee tomorrow</a> to answer lawmaker questions on the proposed deal. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

It’s a worst-case scenario for both the polar bears and people because proximity increases the potential for conflict. </p>\n<p>At least <a href=\"http://dvinanews.ru/-9bgch7xf\">52 polar bears have visited</a> the village of Belushya Guba on the Novaya Zemlya islands in northern Russia over the past few months, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/02/11/mass-invasion-polar-bears-is-terrorizing-an-island-town-climate-change-is-blame/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.dc147748f236\"><em>The Washington Post </em>reports</a>. The bears are getting into homes and office buildings, prompting officials to declare a state of emergency. Videos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/11/russian-islands-emergency-mass-invasion-polar-bears-novaya-zemlya\">uncovered by <em>The Guardian</em></a><em> </em>that purport to show the bear invasion show them chowing down at the local dump. It’s exactly the behavior experts expect given the easy access to garbage in the town and the shrinking sea ice where polar bears would typically hunt. It’s a preview of what’s to come as climate change continues to reduce sea ice and people keep expanding into a thawing Arctic. </p>\n<p>To be clear, polar bear attacks on people have historically been fairly rare, says <a href=\"https://polarbearsinternational.org/profiles/geoff-york/\">Geoff York</a>, senior director of conservation at the nonprofit Polar Bears International. “Polar bears see people, people see polar bears, everybody walks away,” he says. But the worry is that when bears and people live close together, the risk of conflict increases. And human food is a major draw to bears of all sorts: that’s why campgrounds in regions with black and brown bears tell campers to pack away food and throw trash into bear-proof containers. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Btq75P-B5Ya/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\"><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Btq75P-B5Ya/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div></div> <div>\n<div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div>\n</div>\n<div> <div></div> <div></div>\n</div>\n<div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div>\n</div>\n</div></a> <p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Btq75P-B5Ya/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\">Новая земля Нашествие белых медведей Режим ЧС!!! #россия #белыймедведь #новаяземля #жизньнакрайнемсевере #север #остров #архипелаг #северныйостров #моймир #russia #newland #north #polarlights #polarbear #myworld</a></p> <p>A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/muah_irinaelis/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> Irina Elis MURMANSK, RUSSIA</a> (@muah_irinaelis) on <time datetime=\"2019-02-09T18:23:48+00:00\">Feb 9, 2019 at 10:23am PST</time></p>\n</div></blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>For these polar bears, other sources of food are hard to come by right now. To hunt seals, polar bears <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16959250/polar-bears-metabolism-seals-arctic-ice-climate-change\">need sea ice</a>. So at this time of year, you wouldn’t normally expect to see polar bears on land, according to <a href=\"https://www.ualberta.ca/biological-sciences/faculty-and-staff/lecturers-adjunct/ian-stirling\">Ian Stirling</a>, an adjunct professor at the University of Alberta who’s been working with polar bears for more than 45 years. This year, the sea ice hasn’t formed on the western side of Novaya Zemlya, and the bears can’t hunt as they normally would. “That pretty well tells the story,” Stirling says. “Climate warming is what’s pushing the bears on land on the western side.” </p>\n<div><aside><q>“Climate warming is what’s pushing the bears on land on the western side.” </q></aside></div>\n<p>But the story’s also more complicated than starving polar bears searching for food wherever they can find it. The video clips claiming to show Novaya Zemlya’s furry new residents show bears that are clearly finding enough to eat, according to Stirling and <a href=\"https://sens.usask.ca/people/faculty/core-faculty/clark-douglas.php\">Douglas Clark</a>, an associate professor and research chair at the University of Saskatchewan. “All of the bears are chubby,” says Clark, who specializes in polar bear and human conflicts. </p>\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Polar bear invasion on Novaya Zemlya as 50 wild animals besiege remote town, and chase people.

After all, it’s an easy calorie source for bears, Clark says. That is, of course, until the bears learn bad habits that put them in conflict with humans, like strolling into homes. “Bears nutritionally do very well on garbage, but then they end up getting shot,” Clark says. The bears probably won’t leave until they’ve eaten everything they can, according to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Anatoly+Kochnev&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS707US707&oq=Anatoly+Kochnev&aqs=chrome..69i57j0.332j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">Anatoly Kochnev</a>, a senior scientist studying mammal ecology at the Russian Academy of Sciences. It’s hard work for a polar bear to catch a seal, Kochnev says in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. “And here is such a luxurious restaurant!”</p>\n<div><aside><q>“All of the bears are chubby.”</q></aside></div>\n<p>The worry is that bears tend to return to the areas where they’ve fed successfully in the past, particularly during the years they spent as cubs. If they learned there was an all-you-can-eat garbage buffet at the local dump, that’s where they’ll go back. “Bears are very traditional,” Stirling says. “They always remember places where there was something to eat, whether it’s a garbage dump or a dead whale.” </p>\n<p>Kochnev says that getting rid of all the trash in the towns on Novaya Zemlya will be key. “You need to destroy everything that attracts polar bears,” he says. That’s what the town of Churchill in Manitoba, Canada, did. Churchill is a popular polar bear stomping ground, and <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/bear-plagued-churchill-opens-alcatraz-of-garbage-1.626340\">in the mid-2000s, the town closed the local dump</a> and shut the trash away <a href=\"https://www.travelmanitoba.com/blog/post/town-of-churchill/\">in a warehouse</a> that became known as the <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/bear-plagued-churchill-opens-alcatraz-of-garbage-1.626340\">Alcatraz of garbage</a>. </p>\n<div><aside><q>“And here is such a luxurious restaurant!”</q></aside></div>\n<p>In the short term, even fencing off the Russian dump with an electric fence could help, says Clark. (He adds that he feels for the people tasked with managing Novaya Zemlya’s influx of polar bears. “It’s a really, really hard job right now, and everybody is looking at them.”) Kochnev also recommends setting up patrols to chase away the bears that enter town. These kinds of preventative measures will be key over the long run, he says. “Otherwise, everyone will suffer,” he says — both people and bears. </p>\n<p>The bears would likely leave town if the sea ice forms up in March, Stirling says, but they’ll likely be back in Novaya Zemlya and elsewhere as sea ice continues to shrink. The situation on Novaya Zemlya is a preview of what’s to come as the climate continues to warm and people push into a thawing Arctic, he says. “What we’re seeing there in Novaya Zemlya is a harbinger of the future.”</p>",

Today Rockstar <a href=\"https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/60840/Red-Dead-Online-Beta-Update\">announced the next update</a> for the game, which is focused primarily on reducing griefing, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18114780/red-dead-online-rdr2-preview-hands-on-ps4-xbox\">a problem that has plagued the online game since its debut late last year</a>.</p>\n<p>The update will include a handful of changes, the combination of which should make for an overall more pleasant experience. One of the biggest changes comes down to player visibility. Now, you’ll only be able to see other players if they’re within 150 meters of you, which should make it tougher for griefers to hunt down and annoy specific players. Similarly, those whom the game deems “overly aggressive players” will have their position revealed to everyone, and the map marker will change color to coincide with bad behavior; the worse you are, the darker red it turns. If you clean up your act, things will eventually go back to normal.</p>\n<p>One of the ways the game previously tried to deal with bad behavior was through bounties; aggressive players would get a bounty on their head that other players could track down, and the worse your behavior, the higher the bounty was. Now that feature is expanding somewhat: in addition to other players tracking you down, you’ll now have to worry about new NPC bounty hunters as well.</p>\n<p>Of course, these changes won’t fix every problem with <em>Red Dead Online</em>’s community — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18183843/red-dead-online-black-character-racism\">the game’s player base has a particular problem with racism</a> — but it at least shows that Rockstar is doing something to tame its virtual Wild West. The update is launching on February 26th.</p>",

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) led eight of his colleagues in the letters, which are addressed to <a href=\"https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/download/t-mobile-and-sprint-letter-to-fcc\">FCC Chairman Ajit Pai</a> and DOJ antitrust chief <a href=\"https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/download/t-mobile-and-sprint-letter-to-doj\">Makan Delrahim</a>.</p>\n<p>“Our enforcement officials are the last line of defense preventing reconsolidation of our telecommunications markets at the expense of American consumers,” the senators wrote. “We urge you to act to prevent this dangerous merger from proceeding.”</p>\n<div><aside><q>“We are deeply concerned”</q></aside></div>\n<p>The group includes some of the Democratic Party’s most prominent leaders, such as Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ), who have all announced that they were running for president in the past few weeks. Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who are anticipated to launch 2020 campaigns soon, also signed on.</p>\n<p>“We are deeply concerned that the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile in particular will eliminate competition that has been shown to benefit consumers and stifle the emergence of new carriers,” the senators added.</p>\n<p>The proposed $26 billion merger between T-Mobile and Sprint was announced last April and is currently under review by both the FCC and the DOJ. If approved, the deal would shrink the United States’ major wireless carrier pool to three down from four, including AT&amp;T and Verizon. </p>\n<p>Executives from both T-Mobile and Sprint have said that the merger would help them deploy 5G wireless networks at a faster rate and would, in time, drive down consumer plan prices. In their letter, the senators argued that this just wasn’t the case.</p>\n<p>“The best way to achieve the goal of high-quality, affordable, nationwide 5G is through competitive markets,” the senators wrote. “This merger moves us further away from the sort of competition we need to accomplish this aim. It will lead to excessive consolidation and undermine innovation.”</p>\n<p>The letter comes amid an already tough week on Capitol Hill for the carriers. Lawmakers on the House Energy &amp; Commerce and Judiciary Committees are holding hearings on Wednesday and Thursday to analyze the proposed merger deal. T-Mobile and Sprint executives are expected to testify at both hearings. </p>\n<p></p>",

In a letter to Heather Wilson, the secretary of the Air Force, the inspector general, Michael Roark, wants to know if the certification process complied with the Air Force’s guidelines for certifying new launch vehicles.</p>\n<p>The news comes nearly four years after SpaceX fought and won the ability to launch military satellites with its Falcon 9 rocket. Before this certification, the Air Force mostly relied on a sole company to launch its payloads into space: the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. But SpaceX also wanted the ability to bid for national security contracts, and the company sued the Air Force in 2014 for not allowing other providers to <a href=\"https://qz.com/333531/elon-musk-settles-with-the-us-air-force-smoothing-the-way-for-competition-in-spy-satellite-missions/\">compete for a multi-year contract worth $11 billion</a>. </p>\n<div><aside><q>nearly four years after SpaceX fought and won the ability to launch military satellites</q></aside></div>\n<p>SpaceX settled the suit after the Air Force agreed to work with the company to certify its vehicles. The company then <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/26/8662881/spacex-falcon-9-certification-military-spy-satellites\">received approval in May 2015</a> to fly national security launches, and these kinds of missions have become a big part of SpaceX’s business ever since. The company just flew a new GPS satellite for the Air Force in December, and it even launched the Air Force’s secretive spaceplane, the X-37B, in 2017. SpaceX also has numerous launches lined up for the Air Force in the future, including a couple on the company’s more massive Falcon Heavy rocket. Air Force officials have <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/air-force-open-to-reusable-rockets-but-spacex-must-first-demonstrate-performance/\">even expressed interest in flying on SpaceX’s reusable rockets</a> that have previously flown to space and back.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear how the outcome of this new evaluation will affect any of SpaceX’s future missions, though. The inspector general’s audit will be done during February and will take place at the Space and Missile Systems Center in El Segundo, California. SpaceX did not receive a heads up about the audit and doesn’t know why it began. However, the inspector general’s office said the decision to the do the evaluation is part of a larger project of government oversight. “This was a self-initiated project by the Office of Inspector General,” Dwrena Allen, a spokesperson for the DoD inspector general, said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “It is one of the key projects in the OIG’s expanding oversight focus on the Department of Defense’s space, missile defense, and nuclear management challenges.”</p>\n<p>There’s been renewed focus on how the Air Force procures launches lately, thanks to a recent letter from lawmakers in California — where SpaceX is located. In early February, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Rep. Ken Calvert (R-CA) wrote letter to Sec. Wilson arguing for a review of how the Air Force awards launch contracts, <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/lawmakers-air-force-launch-procurement-strategy-undermines-spacex/\">according to a report in <em>Space News</em></a>. The letter was in response to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/10/17961832/defense-department-launch-service-agreement-ula-blue-origin-northrop-grumman\">a recent round of contracts that the Air Force awarded in October</a>, meant to further the development of new launch vehicles that could fly national security payloads. The awards, worth a combined $2.3 billion, went to three companies: Blue Origin, Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, and United Launch Alliance. SpaceX was left out, despite the fact the company is developing a new massive rocket called the Starship.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the Air Force will select at least two launch providers that can compete for national security contracts beginning in 2020. Since SpaceX is currently certified to launch military satellites, it’s still in the running, despite not receiving the October investment from the Defense Department. But in their letter, Feinstein and Calvert argued that the recent awards created an “unfair playing field,” according to <em>Space News</em>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Updated February 12th, 2:55PM ET: </strong></em><em>This article was updated to include new information about SpaceX’s awareness of the audit.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Updated February 12th, 1:20PM ET: </strong></em><em>This article was updated with a statement from the Defense Department’s inspector general’s office.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

The research spun out of his own weather worries: “I really like snow, and I thought, <em>Is that still going to happen up here?</em>” he said. But when he looked up his current home in Cumberland, Maryland, he found that it would soon feel like southern Kentucky. He groaned. “I lived in Knoxville for several years, in central Tennessee, when I was doing my Ph.D., and I couldn’t wait to get out of there because it was so hot and humid. I thought, <em>Ugh, the climate’s following me up here</em>.”</p><p>Even though Fitzpatrick works with climate data all the time—and knew, as he put it, that “it’s gonna get warmer, whatever”—he had never thought about it like this. “If I have grandkids and they lived in the same place I do,” he said, “they might not recognize this climate that we’re living in now.”</p><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/QvLwHJvAqE4\" height=\"1\">",

Apple bans porn within apps, while gambling apps are permitted but strictly overseen.</p>\n<p>There’s no indication that these apps inappropriately collected data on users, but they clearly violated Apple’s enterprise program rules, which only allow distribution to employees of the company they’re being issued by. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/\">When <em>TechCrunch</em> uncovered</a> last month that Facebook and Google used those programs to distribute apps externally, both companies had their ability to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18203551/apple-facebook-blocked-internal-ios-apps\">use all of their enterprise apps</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18205795/apple-google-blocked-internal-ios-apps-developer-certificate\">temporarily shut down</a>.</p>\n<p>At this point, it’s clear there’s an issue with how Apple oversees its enterprise app program. While it’s a necessary service — companies need ways to distribute internal tools and more powerful apps, without going through the App Store — these violations from companies big and small suggest there’s not enough oversight on how it’s being used. That could be a problem if a bad actor were using it to install apps that closely monitored a user in ways that are otherwise banned.</p>\n<p>Apple has pulled several of the apps identified by <em>TechCrunch</em>, and it said in a statement that developers who abuse the program will have their ability to distribute apps terminated; they may also be cut off from the program permanently. “We are continuously evaluating the cases of misuse and are prepared to take immediate action,” Apple said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/apple-porn-gambling-apps/\"><em>TechCrunch </em>has more details</a> on how the apps were being distributed.

Henson plays a high-stakes sports agent who, after a slapstick-y mishap, gains the power to hear the inner thoughts of the men (and only the men) in her immediate vicinity. She immediately decides to use her power to get ahead at work. The premise and title may sound familiar: <em>What Men Want</em> is a remake of <em>What Women Want</em>, Nancy Meyers’ 2000 comedy starring Mel Gibson. This isn’t the first recent story to riff on a previous project by swapping protagonists’ genders or races — 2018’s in-continuity franchise installment <em>Ocean’s 8</em> and the 2016 separate-continuity reboot <em>Ghostbusters</em> are two high-profile examples — but the practice goes back at least as far as 1940’s gender-swapped cinematic take on the stage play <em>The Front Page </em>as <em>His Girl Friday</em> or the 1943 stage musical (and later, film) <em>Carmen Jones</em>, which added a black cast and a contemporaneous flavor to the 1875 opera <em>Carmen</em>.</p>\n<p><em>What Men Want</em> won’t be the last protagonist-swap remake, either. Later this year, Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson’s <em>The Hustle</em> will redo <em>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</em> (itself a remake of <em>Bedtime Story</em>). This year’s Sundance film festival saw the debut of a gender-swapped version of 2006’s <em>After The Wedding</em>, with Julianne Moore in the Mads Mikkelsen role. And there are <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/01/channing-tatum-splash-remake-happening-soon-jillian-bell-1202039281/\">still plans</a> for a remake of the 1984 mermaid rom-com <em>Splash</em>, with Channing Tatum as a merman and Jillian Bell as the human woman he loves.</p>\n<div><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HeoLiTirRp4?rel=0\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p>But remakes based on identity flips still cause consternation, and not exclusively among reactionary shut-ins outraged that four women would attempt to bust ghosts without a dude to hold their hands. (Though this group does tend to be the loudest.) Some of the people who complained about the 2016 <em>Ghostbusters </em>remake, sight unseen, insisted that they didn’t object to the female cast; they were just generally angry about remakes and reboots and the cynical notion that audiences might flock to a money-grubbing rehash under the guise of gender parity, rather than supporting original films. (It’s certainly possible to dismiss remakes and reboots out of allegiance to more original movies, but doing it in good faith requires some due diligence — like, for example, seeking out accessible but underseen movies like <em>Tully,</em> <em>Widows</em>, or <em>Leave No Trace</em>.)</p>\n<p>On the opposing side, some people feel that if audiences want to see a group of lady movie stars pull off <em>Ocean’s</em>-style heists and Hollywood actually bothers to make that movie, it’s a long-overdue net positive. These kinds of remakes typically offer two major opportunities, either together or separately. One is simply offering the surface pleasures of a mainstream movie that fills major or multiple roles with members of underrepresented groups; watching, for example, Sandra Bullock, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, Cate Blanchett, and Mindy Kaling play off each other, rather than squeezing one of them into the token “girl” role in a male-driven ensemble. That sounds like a bare minimum for progress, but considering how few movies place women in leading roles (<a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2018/12/movies-female-leads-outperform-men-box-office-1202027210/\">less than half as many as those starring men</a>), movies with four or five female leads, aimed at general audiences looking for a good time start to look revolutionary.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F3iGURBWZnS_qDavdSSOjzn1Bnw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13754091/fb_oceans_8.jpg\">\n<cite>Photo by Barry Wetcher / Warner Bros.</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>At the same time, cast-flipped movies have a unique opportunity to explore ideas about sexual or racial roles and politics by placing characters of different backgrounds in familiar, often male-dominated contexts. <em>His Girl Friday</em> became a celebration of a working woman in addition to a comedy of remarriage. The 2016<em> Ghostbusters</em> was more of a lark than a serious statement, but younger audience members seeing four women kick ass through a sci-fi / fantasy adventure took it as seriously as so many young people took the 1984 original. No one wants flipped remakes to take the place of incisive, original stories about marginalized groups, but incisive, original stories are endangered either way, and some of the best big studio entertainments are able to smuggle some intelligence and insight into a multiplex. If familiar brand names can be used to tell stories that don’t only reflect a white, straight, male point of view, that’s more justification than most remakes can boast. Both the fun and the serious aspects of flipped remakes lend them some built-in creative interest exceeding, say, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop_(2014_film)\">pointless redo of<em> Robocop</em></a>.</p>\n<p><em>What Men Want</em> doesn’t feel pointless. It has an opening to address gender and racial politics in a comic setting, and it isn’t risking much ill will by tinkering with <em>What Women Want</em>. It’s flipping the script on a creaky, kind of dopey comedy, rather than a beloved fan classic. So when this particular remake falters, it’s even more disappointing. The problems may have begun with a behind-the-scenes swap. Instead of a woman directing a movie about a man learning about women, it has a man directing a movie about a woman learning… well, by the end, it’s not entirely clear.</p>\n<p>Henson’s character, Ali, has a relevant, relatable dilemma at the start of the movie: she’s a woman working in a male-dominated field, often left out of “locker-room talk” (the movie pulls several phrases from recent national news, with a wink) because of her gender, but she’s also quietly vilified for acting too much like one of the guys. Her newfound psychic abilities let her cut through office maneuvering and appeal straight to the desires of hot potential client Jamal (Shane Paul McGhie) and his mercurial dad-manager (Tracy Morgan). Despite her skill as an agent, she has to literally read minds to compete with her male colleagues.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7_iJ63_T4imTLD-Vhohhznk4i0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13754097/MV5BMjA3NTk4ODk5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2MzgxNzM_._V1_SX1500_CR0_0_1500_999_AL_.jpg\">\n<cite>Photo: Paramount Pictures</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>Yet the reconfigured movie’s gender politics are muddled, even more so than its source material. Ali’s powers enable some funny side revelations about guys walking around with mindless tunes or ridiculous questions bouncing through their heads. But mainly, she “learns” what she basically already knew: that a lot of men privately and unfairly think of her as a ball-buster. It also implies she shouldn’t care so much about what men think.</p>\n<p>Except the movie makes it clear that men <em>do</em> affect her opportunities at work, whether she cares about their thoughts or not. What’s more, her stereotypically “male” aggression doesn’t seem like a front she can drop to be more authentically herself. It seems to be part of her personality, but the movie still implies it needs to be fixed. She does learn to be kinder to a sweet-natured bartender / love interest and to her faithful assistant, but those changes don’t come with any realizations about gender, or about how to navigate sexism and the glass ceiling. <em>What Men Want</em> pays mild lip service to the fact that Ali isn’t just a woman in a male-dominated space, but a black woman in a space where white men compete to serve a number of black clients. It just never digs into those racial dynamics.</p>\n<p>That’s a shame because Henson is obviously game for both righteous fury about inequality and goofing around with bedroom farce. <em>What Men Want</em> has clever moments where it goofs on masculine fronts: there’s a running gag where the male characters act laconic and chill on the outside, while their thoughts reveal that they’re secretly exploding with childlike glee about, say, meeting their sports heroes. But the film often lets the guys off easy, providing a token good dude who Ali has misjudged and, only briefly, lightly poking at the idea that a white guy’s forthrightness is called “bold,” while a black woman with the same qualities is tagged as “angry.” This material is always kept toothlessly at the margins of the movie. But why evoke a real, significant social problem in a satire, then refuse to grapple with it?</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VPLOgvcToyYq09WmNZ9VFkYBVbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13754112/gb_001.jpg\">\n<cite>Photo by Hopper Stone / SMPSP</cite>\n</figure>\n<p>Doubtless, there are plenty of filmmakers, male and female, who could have pulled off a delicate balance of comedy about gendered expectations, conscious and unconscious discrimination, and workplace politics. But director Adam Shankman of <em>Bringing Down the House</em> and several ineptly staged musicals doesn’t have the comic chops to reimagine this material. He and his writing team seem to expect that flipping enough details from the original premise will be inherently comedic. But intentionally or not, they often just follow the original script.</p>\n<p>The filmmakers behind <em>Ocean’s 8</em> and <em>Ghostbusters</em> were also content to riff on their predecessors’ work rather than recontextualizing it, but those films at least had a glow of female camaraderie and a lot of star chemistry. The conceptual laziness that rankled some viewers also allowed those films to fit comfortably alongside their predecessors. Paul Feig has a different comic approach than original <em>Ghostbusters</em> director Ivan Reitman, and Gary Ross can’t match the style of <em>Ocean’s</em> trilogy director Steven Soderbergh, but they do carry on their respective series’ traditions of making goof-off hangout movies disguised as big-budget missions.</p>\n<p>So far, the contemporary practice of identity-flipped remakes or sequels has produced more disposable fun films than great or even memorable movies. It would probably help if more of these films were directed by women and people of color, rather than just starring them. People who’ve actually experienced racism and sexism may be bolder about addressing it in fiction and less inclined to play it off for light, easy, disposable gags. But it’s still fair to say that any remake or continuation of, say, <em>Ghostbusters </em>(including the planned <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/16/18185309/ghostbusters-sequel-jason-reitman-2020\">Jason Reitman-directed version</a>) is unlikely to fully recapture the original film’s magic, and a gender-flipped <em>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</em> sounds more fun than revelatory. The business of remaking and sequelizing is always going to be mostly that: a business.</p>\n<p>The remake business isn’t going away anytime soon, whether genders flip or not. Even outside of the big-budget franchise world, the fourth version of <em>A Star is Born</em> just came out to acclaim, big box office sales, and multiple Oscar nominations. (Wouldn’t it have at least been interesting to reverse the naïve starlet / industry-veteran-guy dynamic at play in all four iterations?) The affable mediocrity of <em>What Men Want</em> is disappointing mostly because a gender-reversed, race-adjusted version of <em>What Women Want</em> has a lot more satiric and observational potential than taking another crack at <em>Total Recall</em> or <em>The Terminator</em>. It could serve as a corrective to everything clumsy and old-fashioned about its source material or at least outdo it on a simple laugh level. Certainly, women and people of color deserve more than endless remakes, but they also deserve to play catch-up with the kinds of popcorn movies white dudes have been starring in for decades.</p>",

After Spotify came <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/21/17378296/r-kelly-spotify-policy-streams\">under fire for removing singer R.

For those of you sitting at your desk with a hand raised, likely sipping a lukewarm coffee that may or may not have been the last cup before the carafe needed to be refilled (you think we don’t know?), put your hand down. You look ridiculous and your colleagues are beginning to talk. Those of you who had your hands raised, and are now feeling a little self-conscious, <i>The Atrocity Archives</i>, by Charles Stross, is going to make sense to you. It shouldn’t, because the contents are mind-warping, strange, and surreal, but it will. I’m sorry.</p>\n<p>As I was saying, today’s review is <i>The Atrocity Archives</i> by Charles Stross, a book that is actually a long novella and a short story combined into one printing and kicks off the <i>Laundry Files</i> series. As of the writing of this review, there are 9 fully numbered entries in the series, so there’s clearly a readership. Considering it’s essentially about an IT guy who’s really good at math trying to contain gibbering extra-dimensional entities it seems like I may be the kind of person who’s a member of that readership. Review spoiler, as is tradition, I am.</p>\n<p><i>The Atrocity Archives </i>is written from the POV of Bob Howard, who starts the series as a low level IT guy working for Capital Laundry Services, the UK’s secret agency for all that goes bump in the night. The back blurb gives away that he quickly “gets noticed” and is bumped up to being a field agent. He subsequently goes on a few adventures, sees some scary stuff, and is generally annoyed by the proceedings. His first few (mis)adventures are told with an interesting but slightly repetitive window-dressing, in that about halfway through the action we fade to him in a staff meeting briefing his superiors on what happened next. I thought that it was funny the first time, but I think it wears a little thin on repeated use. Luckily this disappears for the most part as the story goes on, but it did stick out to me.</p>\n<p>I don’t really hold it against the book overall, though, as one of the main selling points of the story is the way it examines and takes apart the day-to-day trappings of working for a soulless (maybe literally in this case) bureaucracy. Bob’s life as a secret government field agent who is licensed to use deadly and high-grade occult weaponry is mainly occupied by staff meetings, corporate liability training, and other equally terrifying drudgery. Bob’s inner monologue as he sits through yet another staff training exercise he’s overqualified for but had to attend because his office had the budget to send someone is dry, funny, and will spring to mind during my next conference call.</p>\n<p>I was also very impressed by Stross’s handling of the actual horror scenes in the book. A great many crossover horror books tend to actually be a fantasy or sci-fi book with a little bit of lip service to horror in the form of a mention of Nyarlathotep or some gore and flickering lights. I can honestly say that there were multiple scenes in <i>The Atrocity Archives</i> where I was truly unsettled. I really can’t get across, without spoiling specifics, how effective Stross managed to be with his horror.</p>\n<p>One thing that stuck out to me in a less-than-positive way was how juvenile the hacker culture aspects of the book were. I’ve waffled from one perspective to the other on this, and since I read this book rather than listened on the audiobook, I can only infer what Bob sounded like when he used terms like “pwnz0r3d” in casual conversation, and since I enjoyed all the other aspects of the book so much I’m choosing on a personal level to believe that Bob is so unremittingly sarcastic that he’s joking when he says it. In the interest of fairness and honesty I have to inform you that in choosing to believe this I’m ignoring some other questionable evidence (e.g. his roommates names being “Pinky” and “Brains”, though again this may just be another in-universe joke for them, it was hard for me to tell).</p>\n<p>I liked the book. I liked the book so much I immediately bought the second and read seven chapters before reminding myself I have other books on my schedule and it can wait. That being said, I think that the writing itself is pretty much just okay, and my enjoyment of it was heavily influenced by the fact that it was written for someone with almost exactly my interests and history of media consumption. I don’t really think this is a “recommend this to anyone and they’ll love it” book, I don’t even think it’s really a “recommend this to anyone and they’ll finish it and still have faith in your recommendations, at least” book. If you have a good grounding in the Cthulhu mythos, but really wanted to experience it from the perspective of a late-twenties British IT guy who’s pretty funny most of the time I’d recommend you pick it up.</p>\n<p>General Audience Rating: <i>The Atrocity Archives </i>– 6.5/10<br>\nWill Audience Rating: <i>The Atrocity Archives</i> – 9.5/10<br>\n-Will</p>",

            "content": "<p>The romantic comedy has been in a state of moderate crisis for the better part of a decade. After spending the early aughts making easy money with pairings of largely interchangeable stars—Kate Hudson, Matthew McConaughey, Katherine Heigl, Hugh Grant, Drew Barrymore, Adam Sandler, Jennifer Lopez … —rom-coms saw their box-office wave dry up abruptly around 2012. As the producer Lynda Obst, a doyenne of the genre, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2012/12/can-the-romantic-comedy-be-saved.html\">told <em>Vulture</em></a> that year, “It is the hardest time of my 30 years in the business.”</p><p>Some rom-coms began experimenting with out-there premises (the “She’s a woman, he’s a zombie” setup of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/02/warm-bodies-a-heartfelt-zombie-love-story/272755/?utm_source=feed\"><em>Warm Bodies</em></a>), while others presented themselves as another genre altogether (<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/11/silver-linings-playbook-a-clear-headed-comedy-about-mental-illness/265327/?utm_source=feed\"><em>Silver Linings Playbook</em></a>, for instance, or <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/06/the-youthful-magic-of-moonrise-kingdom/257973/?utm_source=feed\"><em>Moonrise Kingdom</em></a>). Lately, many of the more successful entrants in the genre have been films that de-emphasized Hollywood movie stars and featured racially diverse casts (<em>The Big Sick</em>, <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em>, <em>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before</em>). But I think it’s safe to say that we are at a moment when no one has a particularly good sense of precisely where the rom-com is headed.</p><p>Into this cinematic breach steps <em>Isn’t It Romantic</em>, a would-be high-concept Rebel Wilson film that intends to revivify the romantic comedy by satirizing it. I am sorry (though unsurprised) to report that it does not succeed.</p><p>The movie opens to the song “Oh, Pretty Woman” and, moments later, to the movie <em>Pretty Woman</em>, which a slightly chubby Australian girl named Natalie is watching on TV. Her mother (a vastly underutilized Jennifer Saunders) warns the blissed-out child to “forget about love.” No one will ever make movies about “girls like us,” she explains, adding, “Someone might marry you for a visa, but that’s about it.”</p><p>Flash forward, and the now grown Natalie (Wilson) is an architect at a Manhattan firm. Sadly, her mother’s warnings about how no one will be interested in her appear to have come true, both romantically and professionally. Despite her career success, everyone in the office treats Natalie like a coffee girl. Even her best friend, Josh (Adam DeVine, Wilson’s co-star and eventual squeeze in the <em>Pitch Perfect</em> movies), seems to spend his days looking out the window at a billboard of a bathing-suited supermodel. Gone are the romantic fantasies of Natalie’s girlhood. She even berates her assistant, Whitney (Betty Gilpin), for enjoying rom-coms, and proceeds to enumerate all the tedious tropes thereof: the adorably clumsy lead, her gay best friend, her female nemesis, the cheesy pop songs, the interruption of a marriage to the Wrong Person. (Take notes. As you’ve probably surmised, these will be important later on.)</p><p>In the subway, a man seems to flirt with Natalie. But no! He’s only trying to get close enough to punch her in the stomach in order to steal her purse. (This is one of those movies with the message “What matters is what’s on the inside” that nonetheless tries to get as much early comic mileage as possible by making fun of how its protagonist looks on the outside.) In the fracas, Natalie bangs her head against a steel beam and passes out. When she awakens, she finds herself <em>in a romantic comedy</em>. All of the aforementioned tropes are in evidence; every good-looking guy is now more interested in her person than in her purse; etc., etc. Even New York “doesn’t smell like shit anymore!,” Natalie enthuses.</p><p>If this sounds an awful lot like last year’s <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/04/i-feel-pretty-is-a-message-movie-that-cant-stay-on-message/558404/?utm_source=feed\">Amy Schumer vehicle, <em>I Feel Pretty</em></a> (in which Schumer bangs her head and comes to believe that she is the most beautiful woman in the world), well, that’s because it is. Yes, it appears we now have an official subgenre of pseudo-feminist movies in which a woman is initially presented as completely unattractive; is concussed into a fantasy in which she becomes impossibly desirable; and from the experience gleans important, affirmative lessons about believing in herself.</p><p data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/04/when-beauty-is-a-troll/558467/?utm_source=feed\">Read: When beauty is a troll</a>]</i></p><p>Sigh. At least <em>Isn’t It Romantic</em> is not as sour and self-negating as Schumer’s film (which was already an improvement on its genre cousin, <em>Shallow Hal</em>). The new movie, directed by the comedy journeyman Todd Strauss-Schulson, offers flashes of charm here and there, and a couple of modestly fun musical numbers. But its moral messages are frequently confused or contradictory, and the movie is neither particularly funny nor particularly clever in its dissection of the rom-com genre.</p><p>Natalie stumbles (literally stumbles) into the Perfect Guy, a handsomely bearded billionaire played by the youngest Hemsworth brother, Liam. Likewise, Natalie’s sweet-natured friend Josh ends up dating the very same supermodel and “yoga ambassador” (Priyanka Chopra) from the swimsuit billboard. Will these two mismatched couples find enduring love? If you don’t already know the answer to that question, then you clearly have not seen enough rom-coms. <em>Isn’t It Romantic</em> ends precisely the way you assume it will by the movie’s second scene.</p><p>Along the way, there are plenty of references to <em>Pretty Woman</em>, as well as nods—some better than others—to <em>The Wedding Singer</em>, <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>,<em> Jerry Maguire</em>, <em>Notting Hill</em>, <em>Sweet Home Alabama, She’s All That,</em> and doubtless others that I’m forgetting. And Natalie of course acquires a gay friend (Brandon Scott Jones), who is written as swishily as any 1980s-movie caricature. The filmmakers evidently believe that if an unpleasant comic stereotype is presented with a touch of irony, it will somehow be rendered no longer unpleasant.</p><p>This is of a piece with the movie itself, which consistently wants to have it both ways. It’s true that it is no easy feat to succeed as both a romantic comedy <em>and</em> a send-up of romantic comedies. Alas, <em>Isn’t It Romantic</em> fails on both counts.</p><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/4uPnpuJm7C4\" height=\"1\">",

The Floods, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/02/westminster-dog-show-families/582322/?utm_source=feed\">who breed and handle smooth collies together</a>, have brought their dogs Cherry (whose full name is SugarNSpice Cherry On Top), Poe (Travler SugarNSpice Witches Do Come Blue), and Tiger (SugarNSpice Hear Me Roar) from Orange County, New York, to Manhattan to compete in Monday’s events at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.</p><aside data-source=\"curated\"></aside><p>Becca and Mara came to Pier 94, on the west side of the city, on Sunday afternoon to set up their dogs’ grooming tables and then have dinner out together in the city (their annual pre-Westminster tradition). Monday’s workday started at 5:30 a.m., when Mara began bathing the dogs and then woke up Becca to ask her to start blow-drying them. And then at noon, the two Floods faced off against each other (and seven other handlers, one of whom was showing Cherry) in the Best of Breed competition, five-year-old Tiger at the end of Mara’s lead and two-year-old Poe at the end of Becca’s.</p><p>Mara, whose female dog Gretel won Best of Breed in 2016 at Westminster, wanted to win it again. This time, though, she says, Poe was a little squirrelly in the ring, and Tiger faced stiff competition from the other females. In the end, Tiger and Poe took home the Best of Opposite Sex and Select Dog titles, respectively; in other words, they placed second and third behind the dog who eventually went on to compete in the Herding Group round at Madison Square Garden.</p><p>“You’re always hoping to win Best, and you never, until you walk into that ring and get a ribbon, know how it’s gonna go,” Mara said later. “But we’re thrilled with what we got. Our dogs went in there and they showed well, and you can’t ask for more than that.”</p><hr><figure><img alt=\"\" width=\"960\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/Westminster_4929/af7bb3324.jpg\" height=\"640\"><figcaption>Owners and handlers groom their dogs in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show “benching area” at Pier 94 in Manhattan.

            "content": "<p>In Maine, police officers who use deadly force on the job are always justified in doing so—or at least that’s apparently the official position of the state attorney general’s office, where every deadly police shooting for the past 28 years has been dutifully reviewed, and the cops have always been <a href=\"https://www.maine.gov/ag/news/shooting_reports_archive.shtml\">found justified</a> in their killings. Does that seem plausible?</p><p>Last year, after a spike in police killings, the <em>Bangor Daily News</em> editorialized that “this 100 percent justification rate rightly raises a lot of eyebrows,” and commended Maine Attorney General Janet Mills for announcing that she would convene a task force to look into “these deadly encounters.”</p><p>The task force’s <a href=\"http://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=1033393&an=1\">report</a>, released late last month, encompasses just 10 deadly force incidents. The final product isn’t as thorough in scope or as detailed in what it documents as criminal-justice reformers might wish. Law enforcement is arguably overrepresented among the members of the review team. And its heavy reliance on official records and lack of attempts to interview witnesses rendered it unable to discover any flaws in bygone reviews. But the report is still better than nothing. It attempts to identify and record “common elements or characteristics in these use-of-deadly-force incidents,” something that wasn’t previously done at all.</p><p>All of the 10 people killed were armed—seven with guns, two with knives, one with a weapon “consisting of railroad spikes attached to one end of a rope.”</p><p>The most striking findings:</p><ul><li>“Of the ten cases reviewed … eight of the individuals were living with mental health challenges. In seven of those individuals, family and friends noted signs of depression or depression formally diagnosed. In only two cases was there evidence to suggest that the individuals were receiving treatment for their mental health challenges. In those cases, the individuals were receiving intensive services and supervision of their mental health concerns, including counseling, case management, and community supervision.”</li>\n<li>“In seven of the cases reviewed, the involved individuals had made statements indicating they were having suicidal ideation at the time, or prior to, the incident. In two cases, individuals had a history of actual suicide attempts.”</li>\n<li>“In seven of the incidents, involved individuals had either alcohol or drugs in their system at the time of the incident. More specifically, the average Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of the individuals involved was 0.241%, with three individuals having a BAC of 0.30% or higher, and one having a BAC of 0.43%.”</li>\n<li>“... six of the individuals had been involved in domestic violence-related incidents.”</li>\n</ul><p>The report’s conclusion underscored a flaw in the way that most jurisdictions in America respond to police killings: with inadequate efforts to collect information that might help to diagnose root causes or reduce the likelihood of future incidents. Or, as the task force diplomatically put it, “Because of the narrow scope of the Attorney General’s criminal investigation focusing on criminal liability, as well as the narrow scope of the Medical Examiner’s investigation, focusing on determining cause and manner of death, the task force did not have enough information to determine whether the individuals, or their family or friends had attempted to seek treatment for mental health or substance use issues.”</p><p>The task force ought to have been charged with gathering that information. Given a sample size of 10 killings, the work hardly seems like too much to reasonably undertake.</p><p>Most of the report’s 10 recommendations touched on mental health. The task force urged “access to mental health services, particularly the availability of forensic, crisis and crisis stabilization beds,” more frequent use of “multidisciplinary teams that provide intensive support and supervision of individuals with serious and persistent mental illness,” more collaborative work between police departments and the families of individuals with a serious mental illness, better training for cops “responding to calls for service where there is evidence a person is living with a mental health or substance use disorder,” better training for police dispatchers “in mental health, substance use, developmental disabilities, other vulnerable populations, and crisis response,” and the permanent addition of a “licensed mental health or substance use clinician” to the state’s Use of Deadly Force Internal Review Panel.</p><p>The task force’s focus on mental illness is defensible—at least in the popular imagination, it is an undervalued factor in police killings in the United States. Still, fixing the problem will require going much further than the task force did.</p><p>Maine’s population is roughly 1.3 million. In the two-year period that the task force says it reviewed, deadly force was used in the state about as often as it was over the same period in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_Germany\">Germany</a>, where there are 82.8 million people, including its share of knife-wielders, alcohol abusers, and the mentally ill. Germany differs in the proportion of its residents with guns and the attitudes and approaches of its cops. Both factors must loom larger in any realistic analysis of why U.S. police officers kill so many people, compared with police in other democracies.</p><p>A task force with more investigatory resources, a broader mandate, and more members willing to ask tough questions about police tactics could do useful work, if elected officials in Maine ever see fit to underwrite one. Meanwhile, many states are doing even less to study the problem than Maine.</p><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/VWgqEwZMOyw\" height=\"1\">",

In January, Mueller <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/federal-grand-jury-working-in-mueller-probe-is-extended/2019/01/04/e480b364-105f-11e9-8938-5898adc28fa2_story.html?utm_term=.fd82cf01274b\">extended</a> the grand jury investigating <em>L’Affaire Russe</em> for an additional six months. The prosecutors are dealing with pending litigation, most <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/dc-circuit-considers-constitutionality-bob-muellers-appointment\">notably</a> the Andrew Miller and the mysterious <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/01/docs-firm-that-handles-cases-for-russian-interests-is-locked-in-mueller-grand-jury-fight-1144016\"><em>Sealed v. Sealed</em></a> grand jury cases, not to mention ongoing prosecutions like the newly-filed Roger Stone case. And there are likely outstanding yet-to-be-filed criminal matters in the Mueller probe as well; Jerome Corsi—who, by his own admission, was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/conservative-author-and-roger-stone-associate-jerome-corsi-says-he-is-rejecting-plea-deal-from-special-counsel/2018/11/26/53fb33a6-e6bf-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html?utm_term=.062eefe442fe\">offered</a> a plea agreement by the special counsel in November and proceeded to disclose that agreement to the press—has not yet been charged. And, of course, remember that Mueller was going to be <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/20/politics/mueller-interviews-white-house-officials/index.html\">finished</a> “shortly after Thanksgiving”—that is, Thanksgiving 2017—before he was going to be <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-long-winter-white-house-aides-divided-over-scope-risks-of-russia-probe/2017/11/19/497557c0-cbba-11e7-b244-2d22ac912500_story.html?utm_term=.b564b3ea1f0e\">finished</a> by or around January 1, 2018, before he was going to be <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/06/26/mueller-might-be-close-to-ending-russia-probe/\">finished</a> by June 2018 before he was going to be finished by mid-February.</p><p>But there’s actually a bigger problem than the possibility that all this eager Mueller-is-wrapping-up chatter may be wrong, just the latest instance of overly hasty anticipation of the Muellerpocalypse: No one knows what Mueller’s “wrapping up” actually means.</p><p>Consider your own reaction to the news: When you learned that Mueller was wrapping up, did you immediately assume that meant things were coming to a confrontation or did you assume it meant the president was getting away with everything? Did you assume it meant that Mueller’s investigation was petering out and that he would file some kind of report? That he would “clear” the president? That he would produce a dramatic spree of final indictments? Or did you assume it meant that Mueller was getting ready to issue some kind of devastating written work product that ends up driving an impeachment? All of these are consistent with “wrapping up,” but they are radically different outcomes.</p><p>It seems a bit weird to speculate breathlessly that we are careening toward some kind of finality without actually knowing either whether the endpoint is, in fact, near—or what we mean when we say that we are reaching it. But for what it’s worth, here are a few possibilities of what it could mean that Mueller is winding down—assuming that he is, in fact, winding down.</p><p>First, there’s a kind of common sense understanding of the term, under which the scope of the work is nearly complete with the exception of a few investigative loose ends that will take a little bit of time to tie up. The scope of the investigation, as <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5316868-AppointmentLetter.html\">stated</a> in the appointment order issued by Rosenstein on May 17, 2017, includes:</p><p>(i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian Government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and</p><p>(ii) any matter that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and</p><p>(iii) any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a) [which <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.4\">governs</a> the jurisdiction of special counsels]</p><p>Rosenstein issued a second memorandum, a partially redacted version of which has <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000162-8b23-d039-a976-dfe7110d0001\">become public</a>, that clarified that Mueller’s mandate includes allowing him to investigate and prosecute certain activities of the former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.</p><p data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/12/trump-white-house-has-no-plan-counter-mueller-report/577417/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The White House has no plan for confronting the Mueller report</a>]</i></p><p>So if you imagine that “wrapping up” means this first option, then Mueller and his team have largely finished probing the story of the links and coordination between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government. They have largely finished investigating efforts to obstruct the probe. And they are probably spinning off the matters that arose in the course of investigating these core things. Yes, there are still issues to be resolved, but those issues are squarely within the realm of what can be gleaned from filed documents. Some of these might include examining <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-31/roger-stone-s-cellphones-computers-hard-drives-grabbed-by-fbi\">newly-seized</a> evidence from Roger Stone; waiting to see whether investigators will learn anything truly significant from Andrew Miller, a matter which is currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit; and resolving the mystery grand jury case, which pertains to some foreign-government-owned institution. In this iteration of “wrapping up,” the team largely knows where it is heading and it’s just a question of getting there. Think of James Comey’s comments about the Hillary Clinton email investigation; by the time the FBI sat down to interview her, he has said, it was quite clear there wouldn’t be a case unless she lied. But the interview had to happen anyway. The FBI was wrapping up.</p><p>The problem is that this explanation doesn’t answer the question of how significant those loose ends are to the investigation or how long they will take to tie off—putting aside the fact that it is now mid-February and the investigation still shows no signs of ending. The famed biographer Robert Caro has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/books/robert-caro-nearing-the-end-of-his-epic-lbj-bio-eyes-a-trip-to-vietnam.html\">wrapping up</a> the fifth volume of his five-volume biography of Lyndon Johnson—the first volume of which was published in 1982—for years. The scope of work is known. He presumably knows what he’s going to say. And yet as Caro <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/28/the-secrets-of-lyndon-johnsons-archives\">has said</a>, he is still “at the age of 83—several years from finishing it.” Countless <em>Game of Thrones</em> fans have been waiting since 2011 for George R.R. Martin to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwSRzPDr5cU\">wrap up</a> <em>The Winds of Winter</em>, the next volume in his “Song of Fire and Ice” series.</p><p>There’s another plausible way to understand Mueller’s “wrap up” phase. It could mean that the<em> investigative</em> phase of the probe is nearly complete—with or without significant loose ends—but that major <em>decisions</em> are still to come. In other words, if the Mueller team has all or almost all of the information it needs, it may still have to decide exactly what to do with that information. Will there be more indictments when the investigation “wraps up” or will prosecutors ride off into the sunset, leaving a report on Bill Barr’s doorstep?</p><p>To say that the investigation is done, in other words, doesn’t answer the question of investigative outcome. If you’re one of those people who have invested a great deal in the Mueller investigation, you might—quite plausibly—see in this decision-point the great cataclysm, the moment in which Mueller reveals all in a set of climactic charges. Conversely, if you’re one of those people who think the premise is wildly overstated and the whole thing is a “witch hunt,”  you’re waiting for the emperor to be revealed as naked. But the point either way in this iteration is that “wrapping up” is not necessarily the end; it’s merely the end <em>of the investigation</em>.</p><p data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/mueller-investigation-and-blue-house-could-doom-trump/576373/?utm_source=feed\">Joshua Zoffer and Niall Ferguson: Mueller and a blue House could bring down Trump</a>]</i></p><p>There’s a third possible explanation: Perhaps both the investigative <em>and </em>prosecutorial decision-making dimensions of the probe are nearly complete, and “wrapping up” means that the special counsel’s office is in the process of drafting a report. In this version, there will be no more indictment fireworks, no more Friday news surprises—or perhaps just a few more. The wrap-up is the writing of some kind of accounting.</p><p>But again, that leaves the question of what that accounting will say. It’s rather different if it contains explosive allegations of presidential misconduct that the prosecutor contends would be indictable if committed by someone other than the president than if Mueller slinks off into history with a report that simply says he found insufficient evidence of any crime to bring a case. Assuming this third explanation is accurate, we also don’t know what form such a report would take or how much the public or Congress would see of it. Will it be made public, as congressional Democrats <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/29/mueller-report-public-house-democrats-1135584\">have advocated</a>? Will Congress even be sent the unredacted version of the report? Or will Mueller submit a document directly to Congress, as Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski did with his <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/watergate-road-map-what-it-says-and-what-it-suggests-mueller\">Road Map</a>? So to say that Mueller is wrapping up in this sense says very little about the outcome of his work.</p><p>But consider a final possibility: All three of these processes could be taking place simultaneously. Mueller could be on an investigative downslope that will take a bit more time; he will then have decisions to make; and he is in the meantime completing his report.</p><p>To sum up, we don’t know how long Mueller will be working; we don’t know whether or how many indictments are left to come or for what; we don’t know what any report will say; and we don’t know when any of this will happen.</p><p>It’s a good thing we know that Mueller is wrapping up.</p><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/0LJVeFoFnDY\" height=\"1\">",

            "content": "<p>As the Grammys dragged into its fourth hour on Sunday night, the storied producer Jimmy Jam told the audience that it was time to pay tribute to yet another titan of music. Dolly Parton had already <a href=\"https://www.stereogum.com/2031567/dolly-parton-tribute-katy-perry-kacey-musgraves-grammys-2019/video/\">presided over her own medley</a> and Diana Ross <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/video/diana-ross-about-2019-billboard-grammy-awards-coverage-on-billboardg1-sourceflv-8497623\">had thrown herself a birthday bash</a>; Aretha Franklin’s <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/grammys-2019-see-aretha-franklins-diva-worthy-tribute-791784/\">memorial was still to come</a>. The recipient of the next fete, rather, would be Neil Portnow, the bespectacled, white-bearded 71-year-old who has routinely bored Grammys audiences since he became the Recording Academy’s president in 2002.</p><p>It’s Portnow’s last year in his run as the longest-acting chief in Grammys history. So after a montage about the Recording Academy’s good works—museums, charities, concerts, opportunities for Portnow to pose with Barbra Streisand—another montage had musicians rave about Portnow’s tenure. Celine Dion bid bon voyage. Chick Corea said, “You’ve helped us keep the music fires burning bright” and played a piano riff. Then it was Portnow’s turn to talk, which he did for longer than any musician’s acceptance speech.</p><p>It was a lot of time devoted to a bureaucrat, and <i>Slate</i>, helpfully, has put together <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2019/02/neil-portnow-grammys-every-picture.html\">a gallery of more Portnow content</a> for the precisely zero people who were left asking for it. This was not just any insider indulgence though; it was an attempt to polish a damaged image. More and more, when it comes to the well-publicized flaws of the Grammys—and really, of gatekeeping institutions of all sorts—public scrutiny is turning toward the behind-the-scenes types who’ve called the shots for extreme lengths of time.</p><p>Portnow found himself in pop-culture controversy in 2016, when <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/grammys-ceo-responds-to-kanye-west-criticism-our-doors-are-always-open-115209/\">Kanye West requested</a> a meeting about making the Grammys more “relevant,” which is partly to say, more inclusive of hip-hop, a genre that hasn’t won an Album of the Year award since 2004. Portnow said he was game to collaborate, but he also gave interviews in which he <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/levels/grammys-2019-did-they-finally-get-hip-hop-right/\">made statements such as</a>, “No, I don’t think there’s a race problem at all” with the Grammys. West hasn’t attended the ceremony since then, and not until 2019—the first show after long-overdue expansions were made to the Academy’s voting body—did a rapper (Childish Gambino) win Song of the Year or Record of the Year.</p><p>But Portnow only became a true celebrity bête noire when, after the 2018 Grammys telecast gave out just one trophy to a female artist, he said women needed to “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/01/the-women-who-step-up-in-the-music-business/551786/?utm_source=feed\">step up</a>” in the music industry. Rebuking female artists and execs who’d long spoken about the structural obstacles facing them, the comment displayed breathtaking ignorance or insensitivity from someone with so much ostensible power in the industry. The ensuing backlash was fierce. Sheryl Crow and Pink tweeted complaints. Fiona Apple played a concert in a <span><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/watch-fiona-apple-slam-grammy-president-with-kneel-portnow-t-shirt-127715/\">Kneel, Portnow</a></span> tee. Vanessa Carlton <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/01/vanessa-carlton-oust-grammys-recording-academy-neil-portnow.html\">campaigned</a> for him to step down. Portnow apologized quickly, and after another scandal—accusations that the Grammys show <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/fired-musicares-exec-accuses-grammy-chief-of-steering-money-from-charity-to-cover-shortfall-exclusive-1202819996/\">siphoned money</a><strong> </strong>away from charity—announced that he would retire soon.</p><p>The brouhaha wasn’t forgotten Sunday so much as loudly atoned for. There was lots of celebrating women in music from the host, Alicia Keys, who started the show by summoning the team of Michelle Obama, Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Jennifer Lopez. The female artists Kacey Musgraves, Cardi B, H.E.R., and Dua Lipa took televised prizes, though the latter did so with a dig at Portnow’s “step up” rhetoric. Then there was Portnow’s speech, which advocated inclusivity in parodically mealymouthed fashion. An<strong> </strong>actual quote that is not from a seventh grader’s civics essay: “The need for social change has been a hallmark of the American experience from the founding of our country to the complex times we live in today.”</p><p>The reaction shots from <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/grammys-2019-president-neil-portnow-speech-reactions.html\">women in the audience</a> during Portnow’s speech didn’t exactly radiate approval. The length and dreariness of his talk, in fact, asked frustrating questions of the viewer. Who wanted this combined display of<strong> </strong>contrition and self-celebration from Portnow? What could he say to cover up the fact that he had run the Recording Academy for more than 15 years and still was able to suggest in 2018, at the height of the #MeToo wave, that women are just not trying hard enough? How much denial did he have to be in about the resentment facing the Academy to say, “Please know that my commitment to all the good that we do will carry on as we turn the page on the next chapter of the storied history of this phenomenal institution”?</p><p>The Grammys—ever tepidly reviewed and <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/02/grammy-ratings-michelle-obama-drake-lady-gaga-kasey-musgrave-cbs-the-walking-dead-1202554369/\">rated</a>—is, of course, not just Portnow’s mess. Which is why it was fitting that days before the show, another backstage figure made headlines for unhappy reasons. Ariana Grande had been advertised as a performer at the Grammys, but ended up pulling out. Ken Ehrlich, the telecast’s producer, <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/404b3a97ff434d919be6efc0e95fe859\">told the Associated Press</a> that it was just a logistical issue. “When we finally got the point where we thought maybe it would work, she felt it was too late for her to pull something together for sure,” he said.</p><p>But Grande, on Twitter, called Ehrlich a liar: “I can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken. It was when my creativity &amp; self-expression was stifled by you, that I decided not to attend.” Grande <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/1093627572598988800\">said</a> she’d offered three songs, presumably from her <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/02/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-album-review-cold-truths/582376/?utm_source=feed\">new album</a>, to play at the show—but was encouraged to do something else in the interest of political game-playing and favor trading. It’s a flap that recalls <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/music/news/why-isnt-lorde-performing-at-the-grammys-sources-explain-1202679146/\">reports from 2018</a> that Lorde, the only woman nominated for Album of the Year, didn’t play because the Grammys’ producers had only offered collaborative, not solo, performing slots, including in a Tom Petty tribute.</p><p><i>You know that, Ken </i>has quickly become a catchphrase among Grande fans, one that—as with the Portnow controversies—brings new attention to a power player who’s been in plain sight for a very long time. The 76-year-old Ehrlich has been producing the Grammys since 1980, which is more than one and a half the amount of time Grande has been alive. He understandably has pointed to that epic tenure when defending himself. “The thing that probably bothered me more than whatever else she said about me is when she said I’m not collaborative,” Ehrlich <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/grammys-producer-ken-ehrlich-ariana-grande-792506/\">told <i>Rolling Stone</i></a>.</p><p>“You can ask Christina Aguilera, who I asked to do ‘It’s a Man’s World’ for James Brown,” he continued. “You can ask Melissa Etheridge, who finished her cancer treatment and I put her out on stage, bald, doing Janis Joplin. You can ask Ricky Martin, who overnight became the creator of the Latin-music revolution. Ask Mary J. Blige, who was scared shitless to go out there and do ‘No More Drama.’ I basically worked with her to mold it.”</p><p>That litany indeed includes some of the highlight moments from Erhlich’s reign. Producing an event like the Grammys is an enormous task involving an overwhelming number of elements—personnel, equipment, creative concepts—and that he’s met that challenge for so long is a real feat. But Ehrlich’s 39-year stint has also seen perennial grumbles from viewers about strange performance choices and overlong, tribute-packed, gimmick-obsessed mediocrity, all of which was well on display Sunday night (one top-of-the-head example: J. Lo, of all people, doing the Motown medley).</p><p>It’s also seen, in recent years, mounting outcry from not just Grande and Lorde, but also <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/01/superstars-are-rebelling-against-the-grammys/515106/?utm_source=feed\">other huge artists</a> such as Frank Ocean and Justin Bieber who for one reason or another have been alienated from what’s supposedly “music’s biggest night.” After Sunday’s show, Nicki Minaj joined their ranks by blasting Ehrlich by name. “I pissed off the same man Ariana just called out for lying,” she tweeted. “Grammy producer KEN. I was bullied into staying quiet for 7 years out of fear.” The full details of their spat would be revealed soon, Minaj promised, building suspense in much the same fashion she has when beefing with rappers. Ehrlich has yet to respond.</p><p>Identity-based theories for why two white male Baby Boomers with incredible job security are in this position may be easy to come up with. But whatever the reasons, Ehrlich and Portnow have been very publicly faltering in the crucial superstar-relations department. Take last night’s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/02/drake-critiques-grammys-during-acceptance-speech/582469/?utm_source=feed\">viral moment</a> when Drake popped up in a rare Grammys appearance to accept the Best Rap Song win. His speech mildly dissed the entire concept of giving awards for art: a classic gripe that he simply put in new terms. But when the show seemed to cut him off to go to commercial, it gave the appearance of producers with thin skin. Later, Grammys sources <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/grammys-producers-cut-drakes-speech-win-1185135\">told</a> <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> that Drake actually finished his speech and was given a chance to return to stage. That they’re having to make such clarifications at all, though, hints at something amiss in the control room.</p><p>Ehrlich has <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-grammys-producer-ken-ehrlich-20190207-story.html\">one year left in his production contract</a>, and has said he’s unsure about what comes next. Portnow has given his last Grammys speech, and the Recording Academy has not determined its next president. The latter leaves behind laudable things: legislative victories, philanthropic work, many supporters in the industry, and, as of this year, reforms in voting and awards giving to address widespread criticisms about representation and relevance. But the fact that such critiques were being made so fiercely for so long is explained, surely on some level, by the fact that the people in charge have been so long-serving. With new blood, maybe this show can be saved after all.</p><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/vPoPjCGcGFg\" height=\"1\">",
